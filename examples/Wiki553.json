Pre-war career Bodewin Keitel was born on 25 December 1888 in Helmscherode, the son of a landowner. He was the brother of Wilhelm Keitel, later a field marshal and head of the High Command of the Wehrmacht. Bodewin joined the army in 1909 and served during World War I. After the end of World War I, he was retained in the Reichswehr, eventually reaching the rank of colonel. In 1937, he was appointed as the Chief of Training Department (\"T4\") and was added in the General Staff of the Army. On 28 February 1938, he was promoted to Generalmajor (major general) and appointed head of the Army Personnel Office. He held this position until 1 October 1942. World War II On 1 April 1940 Keitel received his promotion to Generalleutnant (lieutenant general) and one year later the General of Infantry (general of infantry). In the period from 1 October 1942 to 28 February 1943, he was granted leave to \"restore health\". His successor in the Army Personnel Office was Rudolf Schmundt. On 1 March 1943 Keitel was appointed commanding general of the Deputy Commanding General XX Army Corps and commander in the military district XX in Danzig. The liaison officer in the military district XX at the time was Lieutenant Colonel Hasso von Boehmer, who by his friend Henning von Tresckow for his resistance to Adolf Hitler, recruited the brothers Stauffenberg to carry out the assassination of Hitler. On the day of the assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler (20 July 1944) Keitel was on an inspection tour in his command area. As first general staff officer, Keitel took Boehmer from the Berlin Bendlerblock and a telegram to Keitel from the conspirators and prompted the first steps. Keitel then heard over the radio that the attack had failed and he returned immediately to Danzig. He confirmed by a telephone call to his brother Wilhelm Keitel that Hitler was alive. Boehmer was taken before the People's Court and executed in 1945. On 1 December 1944 Bodewin Keitel was moved into the F\u00fchrerreserve of the Army High Command (OKH). On 3 May 1945 he became a U.S. prisoner of war, then dismissed on 17 April 1947.

Before coming to Purdue, Burnham coached football at Central High School in South Bend, Indiana for 16 seasons, tallying a mark of 118\u201330\u20138.\n\n  Early life, education, and YMCA work Elmer Harold Burnham was born on September 8, 1894 at his family's home at 154 Main Street, West Newbury, Massachusetts. He was the only son among four children of Benjamin Franklin Burnham (a milkman) and Mary Choate Stanley Burnham. Burnham's athletic ability was evident from an early age. He won track and field events at local YMCA meets, played high school basketball, captained his high school baseball team. Burnham did not play high school football because West Newbury was too small to field a team. When playing local league baseball at 17, he was described as \"[w]ithout a doubt the best amateur infielder in this vicinity,\" having begun playing \"as soon as he was big enough to lift a bat.\" Decades after his playing days ended, Burnham was called \"an exceptional athlete, possibly the best West Newbury High ever had,\" who could have done well in a much larger school. After graduating high school in 1911 (as a classmate of noted WAC commander Captain Frances Keegan Marquis), Burnham entered Springfield Training School, a Springfield, Massachusetts, college closely connected to the YMCA and known for its strong physical education program. In August 1913, after two years' study at Springfield, Burnham became an assistant athletics director of South Bend, Indiana's YMCA. Advisors at Springfield suggested the year's break because Burnham was so youthful in appearance, they doubted they could place him in a coaching position.Burnham returned to Springfield in the 1915-16 school year to complete his physical education training, where he won letters in football, baseball, tennis, and basketball, starring particularly in the latter. In 1924-25, he attended coaching schools under famed University of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, with whom Burnham had worked on South Bend community sports events as early as 1917. At the time of Burnham's graduation, Springfield offered only a three-year program: in 1935 he completed coursework to obtain a bachelor's degree in physical education from Notre Dame. Coaching career In a career not known for job security, Burnham served for years at each school where he coached, always leaving on good terms and on his own terms. His decades of high school and college coaching in Indiana were appreciated by \"all Hoosiers, who have come to call him one of their own,\" and in 1975 Burnham was inducted into the Indiana Football Hall of Fame. In Rochester, New York, he was viewed as \"a quiet, modest man,\" respected and admired by those on his teams: \"There has been a lot of silly talk about the character building purposes of football. When Elmer Burnham is mentioned in this connection, it doesn't sound so silly.\" Central High School In 1916, Burnham was appointed coach at South Bend's Central High School, where, in addition to teaching phys ed, he coached all sports, developing strong teams from the outset. Opened in 1913, Central High was an important South Bend institution: a place of civic pride not only in its impressive size and architecture but also for its successful sports teams. With the exception of the school years 1917-18 (when he served as a sergeant in the 309th Trench Mortar Battery during World War I) and 1920-21 (when he returned to West Newbury, staying with his parents and working with his father in the family dairy) Burnham coached steadily at Central High School until 1935, becoming a South Bend institution himself: as one columnist stated, \"Many of the young, successful business men of South Bend today received their early training from Elmer Burnham.\" During Burnham's tenure at the high school, South Bend took off as a manufacturing hub. The city's population grew from 58,684 in 1910 to 70,983 in 1920 to 104,193 in 1930. Central High School\u2014and its athletic program\u2014grew as well. In early years at Central, Burnham was one of only two phys ed teachers, coaching a range of high school sports (taking his football, basketball, baseball, and track teams to championships), while also starring on the South Bend YMCA basketball team and serving as City Recreational Director.Later, Burnham was particularly known as the high school's football coach. In his last five years, the Central football team \"won 42 games, lost six and tied five, scoring 1,083 points against their opponents' 181.\" By 1934 Central's coaching program had been revamped and several new coaches had been added, including an English teacher and basketball coach named John Wooden, who succeeded Burnham as baseball coach and in the South Bend city recreation job, and whose subsequent basketball coaching career at the University of California, Los Angeles earned him the sobriquet \"Wizard of Westwood.\" As Burnham was leaving in 1935 to coach at Purdue University, South Bend held a testimonial banquet in his honor, attended by 400 friends and admirers. Purdue Freshman football coach In the spring of 1935, Purdue athletic director\/head football coach Noble Kizer, with whom Burnham played basketball at the South Bend YMCA, recruited Burnham as Purdue's freshman football coach. Burnham was credited as \"largely responsible for making such successful Purdue football teams\" and as the \"best freshman football coach in the country.\" During his time as Purdue's freshman coach, Burnham, viewed as an authority on recreational sports, helped develop a state-wide amateur baseball program in Indiana, and gave speeches on a variety of sports topics. Head football coach Burnham's ascendancy to Purdue's head football coach position in February 1942 came in inauspicious circumstances. America had entered World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Both coaching and player rosters changed as men began to join the service. And the military took an active role in college football during the war, transferring players among schools with orders to report in different locations and building its own elite training base teams, which included some professional players.At the same time, the Purdue Boilermakers football program was in turmoil. In January 1942, Allen (Mal) Elward had been removed as the school's athletic director because of the football team's poor 1941 performance, but was to stay on as the football coach for the remainder of the year. The college newspaper called Elward's retention a betrayal, stating that he was widely and deeply unpopular: \"Members of the team had vowed they would no longer play if Elward remained.\" Thereupon Elward resigned to join the Navy, and within a month Burnham\u2014a well-known and popular figure in Boilermakers football\u2014became head coach. 1942 season As the 1942 football season approached, sportswriters noted that Purdue's morale had improved with the new coaching staff and the introduction of new formations and plays, but warned that the Boilermakers faced a daunting schedule. With the exception of a 7-6 upset over Northwestern University, Purdue's 1942 season was one of losses. Burnham committed to \"do better next season, if there is college football.\" 1943 season The one sure thing in the 1943 football season was uncertainty. Burnham and Purdue's athletic director considered suspending football that year, but in April spring drills proceeded with the knowledge that many players could be gone before the season started. Burnham said, \"Most of the boys won't be with us this fall, but they are out here every afternoon because of their love of the game and a desire to maintain themselves in top-notch physical condition. I only hope that the training we have been able to provide will make them better soldiers, sailors, or marines.\" In August, thanks in good measure to transplants from Illinois and Missouri, as well as the Navy's V-12 officer training program at Purdue, Burnham was confronted with a record-breaking 113-man squad of football aspirants, a cohort so large it was split into two groups for training. This 1943 Boilermakers football team proved unbeatable. Burnham's final football game at Purdue was the traditional season-culminating battle for the Old Oaken Bucket trophy passed between Purdue and arch-rival University of Indiana. The year before, the Indiana Hoosiers handed Purdue a 20-0 defeat, the third in three years. On November 20, 1943, the Boilermakers beat the Hoosiers 7-0 at Indiana's Bloomington home stadium. This gave Purdue not only the Old Oaken Bucket, but also an undefeated season and a tie with the University of Michigan for the Big Ten Conference championship.By such measures as first downs, forwards completed, yards lost on penalties, Indiana played a better game. The Hoosiers came within inches of a touchdown several times, as late as the last minutes of the game, but were frustrated in each attempt. It was the first time Indiana had been held scoreless since 1939. One writer summed up: \"The only punch Indiana was able to display in the vicinity of Purdue's goal line ... was a roundhouse right to [Purdue quarterback] Sam Vacanti's jaw, swung by [Indiana quarterback] John Cannady on the last play of the game....\" Rochester In May 1944, Burnham accepted the positions of head football coach and associate professor of physical education at the University of Rochester, a private research university in upstate New York, which offered him more money and job security. Unlike Purdue, Rochester provided no scholarships, subsidies of room and board, or other enticements for premier athletes and even with the hiring of a Big Ten coach, had no intent to become a major football powerhouse\u2014which Burnham said he preferred. Burnham's predecessor at Rochester, Dudley DeGroot, had left abruptly to coach the Washington Redskins amidst tensions over his big league coaching approach at a small college.In Burnham's first season, an important victory against Colgate University reassured Rochester fans that the \"graying and fatherly pigskin professor from Purdue\" could provide a respectable team with as many or more wins as losses. In his seventeen years coaching at Rochester, Burnham exceeded those expectations, even though, because studies came first, practices were short in duration and often sparsely attended. During Burnham's \"glory years\" for Rochester football, the team was undefeated in 1952 and 1958, with a cumulative record of 82-42-6 in 1944-60. At his retirement, Rochester's athletic director called him \"our greatest football coach of all-time.\" Rochester's winningest coach, Burnham was inducted into Rochester's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1992. Personal life and death On June 12, 1920, Burnham wed Grace Alexandra Spurgin in her native Chicago, Illinois. The couple had served together as the only two physical education teachers at South Bend Central High School in the school year 1919-20. They had two girls and a boy who became a star football player at Oberlin College. The family spent holidays and summers at the Burnham homestead in West Newbury. There Burnham participated in American Legion events and recreational sports. In retirement, Burnham divided his time between homes in Rochester and West Newbury. In 1961, West Newbury's annual town meeting voted to name the boys' league baseball field after him.Burnham died on March 9, 1977 in Rochester, New York. He was 82. His funeral and burial took place in West Newbury.

He is currently a special assignment scout for the Pittsburgh Penguins. Until 2013 he was the team's longtime goaltending coach, during which time the team won three Stanley Cups. Meloche was born in Montreal, Quebec.  Playing career After playing junior hockey with the Verdun Maple Leafs, and loaned to the Quebec Remparts at the 1970 Memorial Cup, Meloche was the 70th selection in the 1970 amateur draft, chosen by the Chicago Black Hawks. His first professional season was spent mostly with the Flint Generals in the International Hockey League, with a two-game stint with Chicago. The Black Hawks were strong in goal with Tony Esposito, so Meloche was dealt to the California Golden Seals, one of the weakest teams in the league. In his first season with the Seals in 1971\u201372, he recorded a strong goals-against average of 3.33 and four shutouts, including one against the Boston Bruins, then a league powerhouse. The Seals' fortunes continued to worsen but Meloche continued to play well as the club's number one goaltender. He faced a barrage of rubber for another four seasons, including the Seals' relocation as the Cleveland Barons. For the next two seasons, Meloche solidly backstopped the Barons, with only a slight improvement in the team. Following the Barons' merger with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978, Meloche was Minnesota's primary goalie and experienced his greatest success there. He spent eight seasons with the North Stars and appeared in the NHL All-Star game in 1980 and 1982. Minnesota experienced success in the playoffs as well, with an appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1981 and the semi-finals in 1980 and 1984. Despite leading the North Stars with 32 starts in the 1984-85 season, the 34-year old Meloche was getting a significant push from fellow netminders Don Beaupre and Roland Melanson, who was acquired from the New York Islanders during the season. With his contract up and two much younger netminders under contract, Meloche's rights were traded to the Edmonton Oilers. With Grant Fuhr and Andy Moog firmly entrenched in the Oilers' net, the trade was an odd fit and not surprisingly, Meloche was on the move again without ever playing a game for Edmonton. Prior to the 1985-86 season the Oilers sent Meloche to Pittsburgh in the deal that landed Marty McSorley in Edmonton. Meloche spent his final three seasons as the Penguins' starting goalie before retiring following the 1987\u201388 season. In total, Meloche played in 788 NHL regular season games over nineteen seasons with a GAA of 3.64 and 20 shutouts. Largely because of his stint with the dreadful Seals and Barons, he ranks fourth on the list of goalies with most losses with 351, only behind Martin Brodeur, Curtis Joseph and Gump Worsley. He appeared in 45 playoff games and registered a GAA of 3.48 with 2 shutouts. Following his retirement from playing, Meloche served as a Penguins scout from 1989 to 2006 and also served as a goaltending coach\/consultant during much of that time. He was on the staff when the Penguins won Stanley Cups in 1991, 1992 and 2009. Meloche and his wife, Sophie, reside in Pittsburgh. His son, Eric, is a professional ice hockey player who played 74 NHL games between 2000 and 2007 for the Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers.

It was originally a part of Albany County, now Columbia County, New York. In addition, he received 1,500 acres out of the manor proper, opposite the city of Albany. Hendrick built a substantial brick house on the latter estate named Fort Crailo.He was a merchant and ship owner who served the public as an alderman in the Albany assembly and on the Commission of Indian Affairs. In 1698 he bought from the Schaghticoke tribe a tract of six square miles on Hoosac River, for which he procured a patent. This purchase interfered greatly with the city of Albany. With van Rensselaer declining to sell his patent to the council, the controversy became a state affair. In 1699 the dispute was amicably settled, and he passed his patent over to the city. Personal life On March 19, 1689, Hendrick married Catharina Van Brugh, the daughter of merchant Johannes Pieterse Van Brugh (1624\u20131697) and his wife, Catharine Roeloffe Jans (1629\u20131684).

They moved to the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan when Walter was a child, where he went to school. Koenig's parents were Russian Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union; his family had been living in Lithuania when they emigrated, and they shortened their surname from \"K\u00f6nigsberg\" to \"Koenig\".Koenig's father was a communist who was investigated by the FBI during the McCarthy era. Koenig attended Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, with a pre-med major. He transferred to UCLA and received a Bachelor of Arts in psychology. After a professor encouraged Koenig to become an actor, he attended Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City with fellow students Dabney Coleman, Christopher Lloyd, and James Caan. Career Early work In Gene Roddenberry's first television production, the 1963\u201364 NBC series The Lieutenant, Koenig played a significant role as noncom Sgt. John Delwyn, who is recommended for Officer Candidates School by the series protagonist, Lt William T. (Tiberius) Rice, played by Gary Lockwood; (in episode 27, \"Mother Enemy\", aired on April 4, 1964). The plot twist, at the height of the US\u2013Soviet Cold War, is that Sgt Delwyn's visiting mother is a prominent, and politically active, American Communist Party member. This sets up various interesting plot tensions involving Delwyn, Rice, and Rice's CO, Capt. Rambridge, played by Robert Vaughn. In 1964, Koenig portrayed a New York City juvenile gang leader in an adaptation of Memos from Purgatory for The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. Star Trek Koenig began playing Ensign Pavel Chekov, navigator on the USS Enterprise, in the original Star Trek television series in the second season, and continued in the role in all of the films featuring the original cast, including Star Trek Generations.One of only two actors to audition, he was cast as Chekov almost immediately primarily because of his resemblance to British actor and singer Davy Jones of the Monkees. Show creator Gene Roddenberry hoped that Koenig would increase the show's appeal to young people. (The studio's publicity department, however, falsely ascribed the inclusion of Chekov to an article in Pravda that complained about the lack of Russians in Star Trek.)As the 30-year-old's hair was already receding, costume designers fashioned a Davy Jones-style \"moptop\" hairpiece for him. In later episodes, his own hair grew out enough to accomplish the look with a comb-over.Roddenberry asked him to \"ham up\" his Russian accent to add a note of comic relief to the series. Chekov's accent has been criticized as inauthentic, in particular Koenig's substituting the \"w\" sound in place of a \"v\" sound (e.g., \"wodka\" for \"vodka\"); Koenig has said the accent was inspired by his father, who had the same difficulty with the \"v\" sound. Most of Koenig's fan mail indeed came from children, and the high volume of letters contributed to his soon receiving a contract as a regular cast member; this surprised Koenig, who had been told that Chekov would be a recurring role. When the early Season 2 episodes of Star Trek were shot, George Takei was delayed while completing the movie The Green Berets, so Chekov was joined at the Enterprise helm by a different character. When Takei returned, the two had to share a dressing room and a single episode script. This reportedly angered Takei to the point where he nearly left the show (although Koenig observed in a 2016 interview that, whilst sharing a dressing room with Takei and James Doohan, they recognised their status as supporting players, and \"didn't think twice about it\"), but the two actors have since become good friends, to the point that Koenig was the best man at Takei's wedding in 2008.The Chekov character never appeared in the animated Star Trek. Though the show's producers had decided not to cast him for budgetary reasons, and purchased his script for an episode of the series titled \"The Infinite Vulcan\", Koenig later confessed that he was upset at being left out of the cast. \"The Infinite Vulcan\" makes him the first cast member to write a Star Trek story for television. He received Saturn Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor in a Film for both Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Koenig reprised the role of Chekov for the fan webseries Star Trek: New Voyages, \"To Serve All My Days\", and the independent Sky Conway\/Tim Russ film, Star Trek: Of Gods and Men, both in 2006, and Star Trek: Renegades in 2015. According to the teaser for Renegades episodes 2 and 3, this would be the last time Koenig played the role of Chekov. Later work After Star Trek, and before the movies started, Koenig found some work as a writer. He submitted freelance scripts to a number of shows, and was the main writer on the show What Really Happened to the Class of '65?.After Chekov, Koenig had a recurring role as Psi Cop Alfred Bester on the television series Babylon 5. He was a \"Special Guest Star\" in twelve episodes and, at the end of the third season, the production company applied for an Emmy nomination on his behalf. He was slated to play Bester on the spin-off series Crusade, but the series was cancelled before his episode was filmed. The character name of \"Alfred Bester\" was an homage to the science-fiction writer of the same name.Koenig played \"Oro\" in two episodes of the Canadian science fiction television series The Starlost, which aired in 1973 on Canada's CTV television network. He filmed a few FMV sequences for a re-released copy of the game Star Trek Starfleet Academy for PCs. The game was later cancelled, but considerable footage from it was recycled for the film Game Over, with Koenig's dialogue dubbed over in order to retrofit his performance into the role of a computer hard drive.Koenig's film, stage, and TV roles span fifty years. He has played roles ranging from a teenage gang leader (Alfred Hitchcock Presents) to Scandinavian fianc\u00e9 Gunnar in the Gidget episode entitled \"Gidget's Foreign Policy\", to a Las Vegas entertainer (I Spy). He returned to space with a starring role in Moontrap and played a futuristic dictator in the video game Maximum Surge.During the early 1990s, he starred in a touring production of the play The Boys in Autumn, playing a middle aged Tom Sawyer, who reunites with childhood friend Huckleberry Finn. Fellow Trek actor Mark Lenard played Finn. In addition to acting, he has written several films (I Wish I May, You're Never Alone When You're a Schizophrenic), one-act plays, and a handful of episodes for TV shows: Star Trek: The Animated Series, Land of the Lost, Family and The Powers of Matthew Star. He has written several books, including Warped Factors: A Neurotic's Guide to the Universe (an autobiography), Chekov's Enterprise (a journal kept during the filming of Star Trek: The Motion Picture) and Buck Alice and the Actor-Robot (a science fiction novel), which was re-released in 2006. He created his own comic book series called Raver, which was published by Malibu Comics in the early 1990s, and appeared as a \"special guest star\" in an issue of the comic book Eternity Smith, which features him prominently on its cover.In 2013, he released the graphic novel Walter Koenig's Things To Come with artist J.C. Baez, published by Bluewater Comics, which compiled the four issues of the miniseries of the same name.Koenig has taught classes in acting and directing at UCLA, the Sherwood Oaks Experimental Film College, the Actor's Alley Repertory Company in Los Angeles, and the California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant International University. In 2002, he directed stage versions of two of the original Twilight Zone episodes for Letter Entertainment.In 1987, Koenig directed his original one-act play The Secret Life of Lily Langtree at the Theatre of NOTE in Los Angeles. In 1989, Koenig starred in the science fiction film Moontrap as Mission commander Colonel Jason Grant.In 1997, Koenig starred in Drawing Down the Moon, an independent film about a Wiccan woman who attempts to open a homeless shelter in a small Pennsylvania town. Koenig played Joe Merchant, a local crime lord obsessed with chaos theory who sends his thugs to intimidate her into shutting down the shelter.In 2004, Koenig co-starred in Mad Cowgirl, an independent movie about a meat-packing health inspector dying from a brain disorder, in which he played televangelist Pastor Dylan. The movie played the SF Indiefest and the Silverlake Film Festival, followed by a limited release in major cities. Mad Cowgirl was released on DVD on December 5, 2006.In 2007, he reunited with fellow Babylon 5 star Bruce Boxleitner for the movie Bone Eater.Koenig received the 2,479th star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame on September 10, 2012.In 2013, Koenig ventured into the steampunk genre, starring in the short film Cowboys & Engines alongside Malcolm McDowell and Richard Hatch. He played an evil newspaper tycoon in Blue Dream from director Gregory Hatanaka. In 2017, Koenig appeared in the 1980s throwback Neil Stryker and the Tyrant of Time from director Rob Taylor, battling puppet goblins as science officer Ray Nabroski.In 2018, he again appeared opposite Hatch in the science-fiction drama Diminuendo, which was Hatch's last performance before his death. Humanitarian work In 2007, Koenig was asked by the human rights group U.S. Campaign for Burma to help in their grassroots campaign about the humanitarian crisis in Burma. As detailed on his official website, he visited refugee camps along the Burma\u2013Thailand border from July 16 to 25, 2007. Personal life Koenig married actress Judy Levitt in 1965; she died in 2022. In 1968, they had a son, actor Andrew, who died in 2010. They have a daughter, Danielle, a comedienne and writer, who is married to comedian Jimmy Pardo.In September 2008, Koenig served as best man at the wedding of his Star Trek co-star George Takei to Brad Altman.Koenig was awarded the Inkpot Award in 1982.

After Adolf Hitler came to national power in 1933, the song became the co-national anthem of Germany, along with the first verse of the \"Deutschlandlied\", also known as \"Deutschland \u00fcber alles\".  Early life Horst Ludwig Georg Erich Wessel was born on 9 October 1907 in Bielefeld, Westphalia, the son of Wilhelm Ludwig Georg Wessel (born 15 July 1879), a Lutheran minister in Bielefeld, and later in M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr, then at the Nikolai Church, one of Berlin's oldest churches. Wessel's mother, Bertha Luise Margarete Wessel (n\u00e9e Richter), also came from a family of Lutheran pastors. Wessel's parents were married on 1 May 1906. He grew up alongside his sister Ingeborg Paula Margarethe (born 19 May 1909) and his brother Werner Georg Erich Ludwig (born 22 August 1910). When they moved from M\u00fclheim to Berlin, the family lived in the J\u00fcdenstra\u00dfe.Wessel attended Volksschule (primary school) in C\u00f6lln from 1914 to 1922, and thereafter attended high school at the K\u00f6nigst\u00e4dtisches Gymnasium, briefly at the Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster (\"Protestant Grey Cloister Gymnasium\"), and for his final two years at the Luisenst\u00e4dtisches Gymnasium, where he passed his Abitur examination. On 19 April 1926, Wessel enrolled in Friedrich Wilhelm University to study law.The Wessel family, influenced by the politics of the father, avidly supported the monarchist German National People's Party (DNVP), and when he was 15, Wessel joined the DNVP's youth group Bismarckjugend (\"Bismarck Youth\"), from which he resigned in 1925. At the time, the DNVP was the most influential right-wing party.Wessel soon began to frequent low-life bars and hang out in flophouses, and also founded his own youth group, the Knappschaft, the purpose of which was to \"raise our boys to be real German men\". He also joined the Wiking Liga (\"Viking League\"), a paramilitary group founded by Hermann Ehrhardt \u2013 the stated goal of which was to effect \"the revival of Germany on a national and ethnic basis through the spiritual education of its members\" \u2013 near the end of 1923. Wessel himself described the Viking League as having \"the ultimate aim\" of the \"establishment of a national dictatorship\". He soon became a local leader, engaging in street battles with youth members of their adversarial groups, such as the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Communist Party (KPD). Later, Wessel joined groups with a more sinister reputation, including the Black Reichswehr and the \"Olympia German Association for Physical Training\", a powerful paramilitary group which was the successor of the disbanded Reinhard Regiment. Nazi Party member Joining the SA The Viking League and the Olympia Association were banned in Prussia in May 1926, when it was discovered they were planning a coup against the government. Realizing the League would not achieve its self-defined mission and was moving in the direction of tolerating the parliamentary political system, Wessel resigned from it on 23 November 1926 at age 19. Two weeks later, on 7 December, he joined the paramilitary Sturmabteilung (\"Storm Detachment\" or SA) of Adolf Hitler's National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP or Nazi Party) He later commented that over two-thirds of his colleagues from the Viking League had already joined the SA and the Nazi Party.Part of the attraction of the NSDAP to Wessel was Joseph Goebbels, the Party's newly appointed Gauleiter (regional leader) of Berlin, about whom he would later say \"There was nothing [Goebbels] couldn't handle. The party comrades clung to him with great devotion. The SA would have let itself be cut to pieces for him. Goebbels \u2013 he was like Hitler himself. Goebbels \u2013 he was 'our' Goebbels.\"Writing in his diaries \u2013 he kept two, one for his political life and one for other matters \u2013 Wessel described the differences between the groups he had been a part of, and the appeal of being involved in the Nazi Party: Bismarck League, that was pleasure and enjoyment, the Viking League was adventure, the atmosphere of the coup, playing at soldiers, albeit against a background that was not without its dangers. But the NSDAP was a political awakening. ... The movement's centrifugal force was tremendous. ... One meeting followed hard on the heels of the last one. ... Street demonstrations, recruiting drives in the press, propaganda trips into the provinces creating an atmosphere of activism and high political tension that could only help the movement. It was Goebbels who had created this atmosphere, which prompted right-wing youth to leave organizations they felt had let them down for the excitement of the Nazi Party's highly visible activism.For a few years Wessel lived a double life, as a middle-class university law student and as a member of the primarily working-class SA, but in some ways the two worlds were converging in ideology. At university, Wessel joined a dueling society dedicated to \"steeling and testing physical and moral fitness\" through personal combat, while with the SA, which was always interested in a good street fight, he was immersed in the antisemitic attitudes typical of the extreme right-wing paramilitary culture of the time. His study of jurisprudence at school was seen through the filter of his belief that the application of the law was primarily an instrument of power; and his personal beliefs, already geared toward anti-Jewish attitudes, were further hardened by the novel From Double Eagle to Red Flag by White emigre General Pyotr Krasnov, which is set between the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the Red Guards' victory at the end of the Russian Civil War, and which was first published in the Weimar Republic in 1922. Krasnov, a former General in the Imperial Russian Army and the White Army, was also a virulent Anti-Semite who accepted as fact The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an Okhrana hoax alleging that \"International Jewry\" planned to control the world, as demonstrating why the Bolshevik Revolution took place. According to Wessel's sister, General Krasnov's novel was enormously influential upon her brother. Activities In August 1927, Wessel traveled in a group of fifty SA men to the Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg, which he described as \"Flags, enthusiasm, Hitler, all of Nuremberg a brown army camp. It made an enormous impression.\" Wessel was with other Berlin-based Nazis making up a group of 400, led by Goebbels. At that time the SA was banned in Berlin. When they returned, they were arrested.Wessel soon impressed Goebbels; and in January 1928, a period in which the Berlin city authorities had banned the SA in an effort to curb political street violence, Wessel was sent to Vienna to study the National Socialist Youth Group, as well as the organizational and tactical methods of the Nazi Party there. He returned to Berlin in July 1928 to recruit local youths, and was involved in helping to implement a reorganization of the NSDAP in the city into a cell-structure similar to that used by the German Communist Party (KPD). Wessel did this despite SA rules forbidding its members from working for the Party.In 1929, Wessel became the Street Cell Leader of the Alexanderplatz Storm Section of the SA. In May, he was appointed district leader of the SA for Friedrichshain where he lived, SA-Sturm 5. with the rank of Sturmf\u00fchrer. In October 1929, Wessel dropped out of university to devote himself full-time to the Nazi movement. In that same year, Wessel wrote the lyrics to \"Die Fahne hoch!\" (\"Raise the Flag!\"), which would later be known as the \"Horst Wessel Song\". Wessel wrote songs for the SA in conscious imitation of the Communist paramilitary, the Red Front Fighters' League \u2013 in fact, the music to Die Fahne hoch!\" was taken from a Communist song book \u2013 to provoke them into attacking his troops, and to keep up the spirits of his men. Wessel was recognized by Goebbels and the Berlin Nazi hierarchy as an effective street speaker; in the first 11 months of 1929, for instance, he spoke at 56 separate NSDAP events.Wessel's Friedrichshain Sturm 5 unit had a reputation as being \"a band of thugs, a brutal squad\". One of his men described the way they fought against the Communists (KPD): Horst made Adolf Hitler's principle his own: terror can be destroyed only by counterterror ... The places where the KPD met were often visited by a mere handful of loyal supporters, and our standpoint was made unequivocally clear to the landlord and all who were present. In the East End [of Berlin] Horst Wessel opened up a route through which a brown storm tide poured in unceasingly and conquered the area inch by inch. By the period 1929\u201330, the continual violence in Berlin between the street fighters of the Nazi Party and other extreme right-wing groups, and those of the Communist Party and other parties on the left, had become a virtual civil war the Prussian police were powerless to control. This physical violence was encouraged by Goebbels, the Nazi Gauleiter of Berlin, who had been given by Hitler the difficult task of establishing a reorganized Nazi presence in \"Red Berlin\" \u2013 a city sympathetic to the Communists and the Socialists \u2013 one that was under the firm control of the Nazi Party headquarters in Munich and was not controlled by the northern branch of the party under the Strasser brothers with their socialist leanings. Goebbels' violent approach was appreciated by Wessel, who preferred it to the official restraint he experienced as a member of the Bismarck Youth and the Viking League.Wessel kept two journals, one specifically about his political life. In neither does he describe his physical participation in these street skirmishes: he refers to \"we\" \u2013 i.e. the SA \u2013 and not to \"I\". Wessel had a weak constitution: he had broken one arm several times while horseback riding as a schoolboy which deformed it, and had been given a permanent exemption from physical education. Nonetheless, he boxed and practiced martial arts while in the Viking League, and boasted in one journal of having mastered ju-jitsu, a primarily defensive art he may have needed to compensate for his lack of physical power. Still, the limitations of his physicality would have prevented him from taking as full a role in the street brawls as his ideology called for, and he may therefore have ratcheted up his rhetoric in an attempt to compensate for his physical disability.Wessel became well-known among the Communists when \u2013 on orders from Goebbels \u2013 he led a number of SA incursions into the Fischerkiez, an extremely poor Berlin district where Communists mingled with underworld figures. Several of these agitations were only minor altercations, but one took place outside the tavern which the local Communist Party (KPD) used as its headquarters. As a result of that melee five Communists were injured, four of them seriously. The Communist newspaper accused the police of letting the Nazis get away while arresting the injured Communists, while the Nazi newspaper claimed that Wessel had been trying to give a speech when shadowy figures emerged and started the fight. Wessel was marked for death by the KPD, with his face and address featured on street posters. The slogan of the KPD and the Red Front Fighters' League became \"Strike the fascists wherever you find them\". Erna J\u00e4nicke In September 1929 Wessel met Erna J\u00e4nicke, a 23-year-old ex-prostitute, in a tavern not far from Alexanderplatz. Some sources claim Wessel earned money as J\u00e4nicke's procurer. On 1 November, she moved into his room on the third floor of 62 Gro\u00dfe Frankfurter Stra\u00dfe (today Karl-Marx-Allee), which he sublet from 29-year-old Elisabeth Salm, whose late husband had been an active Communist Red Front Fighter, although she described herself as apolitical. After a few months, there was a dispute between Salm and Wessel over unpaid rent in which Salm claimed that Wessel threatened her. The landlady \u2013 who may have feared that she could lose them if J\u00e4nicke, who she assumed was a working prostitute, was found to be living there \u2013 wanted J\u00e4nicke to leave but the latter refused to, so on the evening of 14 January 1930 Salm appealed to Communist friends of her late husband for help. At first the Communists were not interested in helping Salm, as she was not well-liked by them because she had given her husband a church funeral instead of allowing the KPD to give him the standard burial rite used for members of the Red Front Fighters' League, but when they realized that Horst Wessel was involved in the dispute they agreed to beat him up and get him out of Salm's flat by force. Knowing they needed a tough guy, they sent word to a nearby tavern that they needed Albrecht \"Ali\" H\u00f6hler, an armed pimp, perjurer and petty criminal. H\u00f6hler, a heavily tattooed cabinetmaker who had just recently been released from prison, was a Communist and a member of the Red Front Fighters' League. Death At around 10 p.m. on 14 January 1930, H\u00f6hler and Erwin R\u00fcckert, another member of the KPD, knocked at the front door of the room where Wessel and J\u00e4nicke lived, while the remainder of the gang of at least a dozen men waited on the street outside. When Wessel, who was expecting a visit from the leader of another SA Sturm group, opened the door, he was almost immediately shot at point-blank range. Although it was later claimed that Wessel had attempted to draw a gun and so had been shot in self-defense, this was denied by eyewitnesses, who said that Wessel had no time to react. The attackers searched the room, removed a pistol from the wardrobe and a rubber truncheon, and then fled the scene, meeting up with the rest of the men in the street. The entire group then returned to their usual nighttime activities.Even as Wessel was lying seriously wounded in hospital, Goebbels was already releasing reports asserting that those who had carried out the attack were \"degenerate communist subhumans\". Wessel received medical attention and recovered somewhat, but eventually died in hospital on 23 February from blood poisoning he contracted in hospital.Following his death, the National Socialists and Communists offered different accounts of the events. The police, led by Chief Inspector Teichmann, and several courts determined that both political and private reasons had led to Wessel's assassination. By 17 January 1930, the police had announced that H\u00f6hler, whom J\u00e4nicke had identified as the gunman, was their prime suspect.It was then reported by a non-Nazi and non-Communist newspaper that J\u00e4nicke knew H\u00f6hler prior to the murder because Wessel had used her to spy on her former clients who were Communists. The Communists, in turn, claimed that H\u00f6hler had been J\u00e4nicke's pimp until Wessel stole her from him, and that this was the motive behind the shooting. J\u00e4nicke denied these stories, saying that she had never been a spy for Wessel, and that she knew H\u00f6hler only as an \"acquaintance from the streets\". The police and courts believed her, and H\u00f6hler was quickly arrested. After a trial, he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for the shooting; the light sentence was the result of the court's finding of extenuating circumstances. Seven accomplices were also found guilty and sentenced to jail. Executions Three years later, after the Nazi ascension to national power in 1933, H\u00f6hler was taken out of prison under false pretenses by then Gestapo chief Rudolf Diels and members of the SA, and illegally executed.On 10 April 1935, five years after Wessel's assassination, and two years after the SA murder of H\u00f6hler, two persons accused of being involved in Wessel's killing were put on trial and subsequently beheaded in Berlin's Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison: Sally Epstein, a Jewish painter, and Hans Ziegler, a barber. The two had been arrested in August 1933, and were put on trial in May 1934 with a third defendant, Peter Stoll, a tailor. In 2009, the sentences against all three of them were rescinded by the Berlin public prosecutor's office. Funeral Goebbels had been looking for someone to turn into a martyr for the Nazi cause. His first attempt was with Albert Leo Schlageter, a member of the Freikorps and a saboteur who was caught attempting to blow up a train in the Ruhr region while it was under occupation by French troops in retaliation for Germany's not making its schedule of reparation payments. Schlageter was executed by the French, and his gravesite later became a Nazi shrine. There were also the 16 Nazis who had died during the Beer Hall Putsch, and would have a memorial built for them in Munich which was required to be saluted when passing by, and who were honored with a public ceremony every year when the Putsch was remembered. With two other party members who headed the list that the party later made of \"Those Members of the Movement Who Have Been Murdered\", Goebbels did not even make an effort to martyr them.Goebbels saw in Wessel's shooting the possibility of a propaganda bonanza. He eulogized Wessel in his newspaper, Der Angriff, in overtly Christian tones: A Christian Socialist! A man who calls out through his deeds: 'Come to me, I shall redeem you!' ... A divine element works in him. making him the man he is and causing him to act in this way and no other. One man must set an example and offer himself up as a sacrifice! Well, then, I am ready! Goebbel's plan was to turn Wessel's funeral into a mass demonstration full of speeches and processions of SA men in uniform, but he could not get the necessary police permits to do so, even after Wessel's sister requested President Paul von Hindenburg to relent.Wessel was buried in Berlin on 1 March 1930. Contrary to Nazi claims, there were no attacks on the funeral procession, which Goebbels claimed was watched by 30,000 people. The funeral was filmed and turned into a major propaganda event by the Nazi Party. Wessel was elevated by Goebbels' propaganda apparatus to the status of leading martyr of the Nazi movement. Many of Goebbels's most effective propaganda speeches were made at gravesides, but Wessel received unusual attention among the many unremembered storm troopers. In an editorial in the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter (\"People's Observer\"), Alfred Rosenberg wrote of how Wessel was not dead, but had joined a combat group that still struggled with them; afterwards, Nazis spoke of how a man who died in conflict had joined \"Horst Wessel's combat group\" or were \"summoned to Horst Wessel's standard\". The Prussian police had outlawed public gatherings and the display of swastikas at the funeral procession, with the exception of a few Nazi Party vehicles. Wessel's coffin was paraded through large parts of the center of Berlin in a procession that took many hours.As the coffin reached B\u00fclowplatz (now Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz), Communist hecklers began singing \"The Internationale\" in an attempt to disrupt the event. The police were unable to prevent abusive shouts and, at some points, flying rocks. No major clashes occurred, although someone had written \"To Wessel the pimp, a last Heil Hitler\" in white paint on the cemetery wall.In attendance of Wessel's funeral was Goebbels, who delivered the eulogy, Franz Pfeffer von Salomon, Hermann G\u00f6ring, and Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia. Prior to the event, Goebbels and G\u00f6ring had discussed the possibility of Hitler attending. In his diary entry on the day of the funeral, Goebbels recalled: \"Hitler isn't coming. Had the situation explained to him over the telephone and he actually declined. Oh well\". Goebbels blamed Rudolf Hess for preventing Hitler from coming, but, in reality, Hitler's decision not to come was based on the advice he received from G\u00f6ring that the danger of an attack on Hitler in the heart of \"Red Berlin\" was too great. Nazi martyr Although Goebbels could not get Hitler to attend Wessel's funeral, Hitler did speak at Wessel's grave three years after his death, on 22 January 1933, for the dedication of a memorial. Hitler called Wessel a \"blood witness\" whose song had become \"a battle hymn for millions\". He said that Wessel's sacrifice of his life was \"a monument more lasting than stone and bronze\".Sixteen thousand members of the Berlin and Brandenburg SA and SS marched past the Communist Party headquarters on B\u00fclowplatz (now the Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz) \u2013 the Karl Liebknecht House \u2013 in a deliberately provocative act that Goebbels was very proud of having staged, calling it a \"terrible defeat\" for the Communists and \"a proud and heroic victory of the SA on behalf of the party\". He felt that the Communists had \"a loss of prestige that could never again be made good\", as they were relegated to fuming on the side streets. Once the \"enormous procession ... led by Hitler, Goebbels, Ernst R\u00f6hm, and other top officials of the [party], ... marched to the St. Nicholas Cemetery ... Hitler spoke of Wessel's death as a symbolic sacrifice.\"That night, Hitler addressed a memorial service at the Berlin Sportpalast, at which the \"Funeral March\" from Richard Wagner's G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung was played, and the stage was set as an altar made from \"laurel trees, branches, candelabra and a larger-than-lifesize portrait of Wessel\". Hitler lavished praise on \"those fanatics who are consumed by the great task of their age\" \u2013 \"fanaticism\" being a positive virtue among the Nazis \u2013 \"who live for that task and who die for it ... [they would] later be not only the martyrs of their struggle but also the seed from which the subsequent harvest [would come]\".Three months later, on 21 March 1933, elaborate celebrations organized by Goebbels were held on Potsdam Day for the inauguration of a new Reichstag. The day began with services at both the Catholic and Lutheran churches there, but Hitler and Goebbels did not attend. Instead, they laid wreaths at the graves of various Nazi \"martyrs of the revolution\", including Wessel's.The death of Wessel and the proliferation of the \"Horst Wessel Song\" was an extension of the Nazi cult of martyrs, which included Freikorps member Leo Schlageter and the 19 Nazis killed in the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, who were reburied in Munich with great fanfare on 8 November 1935.Goebbels continued to use Wessel's martyrdom as a propaganda device for years. At the 1934 Nuremberg Party Rally, a group of Hitler Youth sang an anti-Christian song which included the lines \"We don't need any Christian truth ... We follow not Christ but Horst Wessel\". Wessel's name was frequently invoked by the Nazis to bolster core tenets of National Socialist ideology during the remaining existence of Nazi Germany. For example, a wartime article from the Nazi-owned V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter newspaper called Wessel \"the hero of the Brown Revolution\" and referred to his \"sacrificial death\" that \"passionately inflamed millions who followed\". The paper further referred to Wessel as \"the driving force behind the struggle for freedom of the armed services and the homeland of the Greater German Reich\". Aftermath \"Horst Wessel Song\" Wessel played the schalmei (Martinstrompete), a single-reed brass instrument which was played in groups called Schalmeienkapellen (\"Schalmeien orchestras or bands\"), and which is still used in folk celebrations. Wessel founded an \"SA Schalmeienkapelle\" band, which provided music during SA events. In early 1929, Wessel wrote the lyrics for a new Nazi fight song Kampflied (\"fight song\"), which was first published in Goebbels's newspaper Der Angriff in September, under the title Der Unbekannte SA-Mann (\"The Unknown SA-Man\"). The song later became known as Die Fahne Hoch (\"Raise the Flag\") and finally the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\" (\"Horst Wessel Song\"). The Nazis made it their official anthem, and, after they came to power, the co-national anthem of Nazi Germany, along with the first stanza of the Deutschlandlied. The song was also played in some Protestant places of worship, as some elements of the Protestant Church in Germany had accepted and promulgated the Horst Wessel cult, built as it was by Goebbels on the model of Christian martyrs of the past.It was later claimed by the Nazis that Wessel also wrote the music to the song, but it was considered more likely that the tune was in reality adapted from a World War I German Imperial Navy song, and was probably originally a folk song. The authorship of the melody was finally determined by a German court in 1937 as not by Wessel. Posthumous notability Hans Westmar Hans Westmar: One of the Many was one of the first films of the Nazi era to idealize a version of Wessel's life. Goebbels, however, disliked the film, considering it to be crude in its use of propaganda, and on the day of its intended premiere issued a ban prohibiting it from being shown. Putzi Hanfstaengl \u2013 an old friend of Hitler's \u2013 who was one of the film's backers, and had composed its music, went personally to Hitler and Goebbels to complain about the ban, which was eventually reversed when enough of the Nazi Party hierarchy weighed in on Hanfstaengl's side. Goebbels, however, insisted on alterations to the film, the primary one being that the main character's name was changed to the fictional \"Hans Westmar\". Part of the problem with the film was that the authentic depiction of stormtrooper brutality, including violent clashes with Communists, did not fit the more reasonable tone the Nazis initially attempted to present after coming to power; unlike Wessel, Westmar preaches class reconciliation and does not alienate his family. It was among the first films to depict dying for Hitler as a glorious death for Germany, resulting in his spirit inspiring his comrades. Memorial namings The Berlin district of Friedrichshain, where Wessel died, was renamed \"Horst Wessel Stadt\", and the B\u00fclowplatz in the Mitte district was renamed \"Horst-Wessel-Platz\" on 26 May 1933. The U-Bahn station nearby was also renamed. After the war, the name Friedrichshain was restored and Horst-Wessel-Platz (which was in East Berlin) became \"Liebknechtplatz\" (after Karl Liebknecht). In 1947 it was renamed \"Luxemburg-Platz\" after Rosa Luxemburg (it has been called Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz since 1969). Passau named a street Horst-Wessel-Stra\u00dfe.In 1936, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine (navy) commissioned a three-masted training ship and named her the Horst Wessel. The ship was taken as a war prize by the United States after World War II. After repairs and modifications, it was commissioned on 15 May 1946 into the United States Coast Guard as the USCGC Eagle (WIX-327) and remains in service to this day.In 1938, an area of reclaimed land in the rural area of Eiderstedt in Schleswig-Holstein was named the \"Horst Wessel polder\".Examples of German military units adopting the name of this Nazi-era \"martyr\" in World War II include the 18th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division, known as the \"Horst Wessel\" Division, and the Luftwaffe's 26th Destroyer (or heavy fighter) Wing Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 26, as well as its successor day fighter unit Jagdgeschwader 6, which was similarly named the \"Horst Wessel\" wing. The Jagdgeschwader 134, formed in 1936, and Jagdgeschwader 142 were also named after Wessel. In 1938, the Nazi Party's Central Publishing House, the Franz Eher Nachfolger Verlag in Munich, published Jagdgeschwader Horst Wessel (\"Horst Wessel Fighter Squadron\") by Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer Hans Peter Hermel to commemorate the presentation of the squadron to Hitler. Post-war After World War II, Wessel's memorial was vandalized and his remains were destroyed. Such activity became common for buried Nazis in East Germany. The gravesite was long marked only by part of the headstone of Wessel's father, Ludwig, from which the surname \"Wessel\" had been removed. Later in 2011, a group of anti-Nazi activists attacked Wessel's grave and sprayed the words Keine Ruhe f\u00fcr Nazis! (\"No Rest for Nazis!\") on the remains of the grave marker. In August 2013, the grave marker was removed and the grave of Wessel's father was leveled as well, as the church wished to stop the site from being a rally point for Neo-Nazis. Since 1989, two petitions have been filed asking that Wessel's gravestone be restored to the St. Nicholas Cemetery. Both were denied.In the modern era, some ultra-right-wing groups have attempted to revive Wessel's name as a symbol. For instance, the Young National Democrats (JN), which is the youth wing of the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), uses his name and his \"history\" \u2013 which was largely invented by Goebbels \u2013 to attempt to inspire their members. In popular culture In the German television series Babylon Berlin, Wessel is represented by the character \"Horst Kessler\".

Early life Kerr was born on 30 November 1887 to Alexander Robert Kerr and his wife, Eliza Sophie (n\u00e9e Clark), in Williamstown, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The eldest of five children, she was raised at Albert Park, and was taught to swim by her mother at the nearby Albert Park Lake. Kerr swam competitively from an early age. Career In 1905 Kerr won medals at both the Victorian and Australasian Championships. During this time, she also gave a number of swimming and diving exhibitions, reputedly performing 366 times in a period of 20 weeks. In early 1906, Kerr went on a six-week tour of South Australia and Western Australia, performing in Adelaide, Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, and Perth. Managed by her brother-in-law, she entered 43 races at which she won 43 prizes during the tour, and also won five open championships.From Perth, Kerr journeyed to England aboard the Commonwealth. At a stopover in Durban, Natal, she gave a performance billed as \"Australia's Champion Lady Swimmer and Diver\", which she would use for the remainder of the tour. In England, Kerr gave examples of swimming strokes which included breaststroke and the trudgeon, and gave displays of \"somersaults, high diving, blindfold backjumps, [and] kneeling dives\". During a performance in Blackpool in August 1911, Kerr rescued two young boys swept out from the jetty at the North Pier by a strong current. Kerr's best time in the 100 yards was 1 minute, 21.4 seconds, and in the mile, 27.5 minutes.

Early life Rangarao was born on 29 June 1859,in Kudmul, a village in south canara (mangalore) in the eastwhile Madras Presidency (now in Karnataka) of British India. He was born into a middle-class Gowda Saraswat Brahmin community. His father, Devappayya, worked as a clerk under a landlord and his mother, Gauri, a housewife. Rangarao completed his primary education in Kasaragod, before losing his father when he was 16. Moving to Mangalore in search of a job, he began working as a teacher for a monthly salary of \u20b98. Completing his matriculation amid financial difficulties through a correspondence course, he cleared the pleadership examination, that certified him argue for a client in courts. Following this, he began his career as a lawyer in Mangalore. Career Rangarao as an advocate in profession was better known as 'the poor man's lawyer'. 'Education is the source of progress' was his tenet. At a time when the depressed classes had no schools, when they were treated with scorn, Rangarao stepped forward as a crusader for the cause. Albeit facing grave opposition, Kudmul Rangarao continued to combat the orthodox beliefs of the then superstitious Indian society. Rangarao set up schools in Kankanadi, Bannanje, Moolkhi, Beloor, Udupi, Nejaru, Atthavara, Baabuguddde, Dhaddal forests for the downtrodden. He called them 'Panchama schools'. To persuade the kids to attend schools, he arranged for mid day meals and 2 paise per day to the parents to develop an interest and motivate the families to get their progeny to schools.

Kharrazi participated in religious congregations and learning theological subjects. His curiosity toward religious matters increased during the campaigns against the Pahlavis and he became more aware of the contemporary political circumstances. While performing his military service, Kharrazi was sent to Dhofar. He deserted the armed forces finally in 1978, according to the direction of Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the revolutionaries. Iran\u2013Iraq War His first considerable command was in Darkhovin region close to Abadan\u2013Ahvaz road, known as \"The Lion Frontier\". In the battle, the Iranian troops resisted Saddam's army for 9 months. He became the commander of Darkhovin front. Kharrazi served actively in freeing Bostan afterwards. Following Operation Tarigh ol-Qods, Imam Hussein Brigade was established which soon was reorganized to a division with Kharrazi being appointed as the Major General. His troops participated in the operations Fath-ol-Mobeen and Beit ol-Moqaddas (which liberated Khorramshahr). In the later operation, his division was among the first which passed Karun river and reached Ahvaz\u2013Khorramshahr road. As a commander he was also involved in other operations like Ramadan, Before the Dawn, Dawn 4; and Khaibar during which he lost an arm. He often reconnoitered combatant's territories himself.

Life Murdoch was born in Phibsborough, Dublin, Ireland, the daughter of Irene Alice (n\u00e9e Richardson, 1899\u20131985) and Wills John Hughes Murdoch. Her father, a civil servant, came from a mainly Presbyterian sheep farming family from Hillhall, County Down. In 1915, he enlisted as a soldier in King Edward's Horse and served in France during the First World War before being commissioned as a Second lieutenant. Her mother had trained as a singer before Iris was born, and was from a middle-class Church of Ireland family in Dublin. Iris Murdoch's parents first met in Dublin when her father was on leave and were married in 1918.:\u200a14\u200a Iris was the couple's only child. When she was a few weeks old the family moved to London, where her father had joined the Ministry of Health as a second-class clerk.:\u200a67\u200a She was a second cousin of the Irish mathematician Brian Murdoch.Murdoch was brought up in Chiswick and educated in progressive independent schools, entering the Froebel Demonstration School in 1925 and attending Badminton School in Bristol as a boarder from 1932 to 1938. In 1938, she went up to Somerville College, Oxford, with the intention of studying English, but switched to \"Greats\", a course of study combining classics, ancient history, and philosophy. At Oxford she studied philosophy with Donald M. MacKinnon and attended Eduard Fraenkel's seminars on Agamemnon. She was awarded a first-class honours degree in 1942. After leaving Oxford she went to work in London for HM Treasury. In June 1944, she left the Treasury and went to work for the UNRRA. At first she was stationed in London at the agency's European Regional Office. In 1945, she was transferred first to Brussels, then to Innsbruck, and finally to Graz, Austria, where she worked in a refugee camp. She left the UNRRA in 1946.:\u200a245\u200aFrom 1947 to 1948, Iris Murdoch studied philosophy as a postgraduate at Newnham College, Cambridge. She met Ludwig Wittgenstein at Cambridge but did not hear him lecture, as he had left his Trinity College professorship before she arrived.:\u200a262\u2013263\u200a In 1948 she became a fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford, where she taught philosophy until 1963. From 1963 to 1967, she taught one day a week in the General Studies department at the Royal College of Art.:\u200a469\u200aIn 1956, Murdoch married John Bayley, a literary critic, novelist, and from 1974 to 1992 Warton Professor of English at Oxford University, whom she had met in Oxford in 1954. The unusual romantic partnership lasted more than forty years until Murdoch's death. Bayley thought that sex was \"inescapably ridiculous\". Murdoch in contrast had \"multiple affairs with both men and women which, on discomposing occasions, [Bayley] witnessed for himself\". Notably she had a long and turbulent love relationship with writer Brigid Brophy.Iris Murdoch's first novel, Under the Net, was published in 1954. She had previously published essays on philosophy, and the first monograph about Jean-Paul Sartre published in English. She went on to produce 25 more novels and additional works of philosophy, as well as poetry and drama. In 1976 she was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and in 1987 was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.:\u200a571,\u200a575\u200a She was awarded honorary degrees by Durham University (DLitt, 1977), the University of Bath (DLitt, 1983), University of Cambridge (1993) and Kingston University (1994), among others. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1982.Her last novel, Jackson's Dilemma, was published in 1995. Iris Murdoch was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1997 and died in 1999 in Oxford. There is a bench dedicated to her in the grounds of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she used to enjoy walking. Work Philosophy For some time, Murdoch's influence and achievements as a philosopher were eclipsed by her success as a novelist, but recent appraisals have increasingly accorded her a substantial role in postwar Anglo-American philosophy, particularly for her unfashionably prescient work in moral philosophy and her reinterpretation of Aristotle and Plato. Martha Nussbaum has argued for Murdoch's \"transformative impact on the discipline\" of moral philosophy because she directed her analysis not at the once-dominant matters of will and choice, but at those of attention (how people learn to see and conceive of one another) and phenomenal experience (how the sensory \"thinginess\" of life shapes moral sensibility).In a recent survey of Murdoch's philosophical work, Justin Broackes points to several distinctive features of Murdoch's moral philosophy, including a \"moral realism or 'naturalism', allowing into the world cases of such properties as humility or generosity; an anti\u2010scientism; a rejection of Humean moral psychology; a sort of 'particularism'; special attention to the virtues; and emphasis on the metaphor of moral perception or 'seeing' moral facts.\" The reasons for this are unclear, but the Scottish literary critic, G. S. Fraser notes that, in the late 1940s, the philosophers who were then occupying Murdoch's attention were late Victorian British idealists, such as T. H. Green, F. H. Bradley, and Bernard Bosanquet. Broackes also notes that Murdoch's influence on the discipline of philosophy was sometimes indirect, since it impacted both her contemporaries and the following generation of philosophers, particularly Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Bernard Williams. She sent copies of her earlier novels to Anscombe, but there is nothing in Anscombe's writing which reflects any of these. Her philosophical work was influenced by Simone Weil (from whom she borrows the concept of 'attention'), and by Plato, under whose banner she claimed to fight.:\u200a76\u200a In re-animating Plato, she gives force to the reality of the Good, and to a sense of the moral life as a pilgrimage from illusion to reality. From this perspective, Murdoch's work offers perceptive criticism of Kant, Sartre and Wittgenstein ('early' and 'late'). Her most central parable, which appears in The Sovereignty of Good, asks us (in Nussbaum's succinct account), \"to imagine a mother-in-law, M, who has contempt for D, her daughter-in-law. M sees D as common, cheap, low. Since M is a self-controlled Englishwoman, she behaves (so Murdoch stipulates) with perfect graciousness all the while, and no hint of her real view surfaces in her acts. But she realizes, too, that her feelings and thoughts are unworthy, and likely to be generated by jealousy and an excessively keen desire to hang on to her son. So she sets herself a moral task: she will change her view of D, making it more accurate, less marred by selfishness. She gives herself exercises in vision: where she is inclined to say 'coarse,' she will say, and see, 'spontaneous.' Where she is inclined to say 'common,' she will say, and see, 'fresh and naive.' As time goes on, the new images supplant the old. Eventually M does not have to make such an effort to control her actions: they flow naturally from the way she has come to see D.\" This is how M cultivates a pattern of behavior that leads her to view D \"justly or lovingly\".:\u200a317\u200a The parable is partly meant to show (against Oxford contemporaries including R. M. Hare and Stuart Hampshire) the importance of the \"inner\" life to moral action. Seeing another correctly can depend on overcoming jealousy, and discoveries about the world involve inner work. Fiction Her novels, in their attention and generosity to the inner lives of individuals, follow the tradition of novelists like Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, George Eliot, and Proust, besides showing an abiding love of Shakespeare. There is however great variety in her achievement, and the richly layered structure and compelling realistic comic imagination of The Black Prince (1973) is very different from the early comic work Under the Net (1954) or The Unicorn (1963). The Unicorn can be read as a sophisticated Gothic romance, or as a novel with Gothic trappings, or perhaps as a parody of the Gothic mode of writing. The Black Prince, for which Murdoch won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, is a study of erotic obsession, and the text becomes more complicated, suggesting multiple interpretations, when subordinate characters contradict the narrator and the mysterious \"editor\" of the book in a series of afterwords. Though her novels differ markedly, and her style developed, themes recur. Her novels often include upper-middle-class male intellectuals caught in moral dilemmas, gay characters, refugees, Anglo-Catholics with crises of faith, empathetic pets, curiously \"knowing\" children and sometimes a powerful and almost demonic male \"enchanter\" who imposes his will on the other characters\u2014a type of man Murdoch is said to have modelled on her lover, the Nobel laureate Elias Canetti.:\u200a350\u2013352\u200aMurdoch was awarded the Booker Prize in 1978 for The Sea, the Sea, a finely detailed novel about the power of love and loss, featuring a retired stage director who is overwhelmed by jealousy when he meets his erstwhile lover after several decades apart. An authorised collection of her poetic writings, Poems by Iris Murdoch, appeared in 1997, edited by Paul Hullah and Yozo Muroya. Several of her works have been adapted for the screen, including the British television series of her novels An Unofficial Rose and The Bell. J. B. Priestley's dramatisation of her 1961 novel A Severed Head starred Ian Holm and Richard Attenborough. In 1997, she was awarded the Golden PEN Award by English PEN for \"a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature\".Literary critics and theorists have given her mixed reviews. Harold Bloom wrote in his 1986 review of The Good Apprentice that \"no other contemporary British novelist\" seemed of her \"eminence\". A. S. Byatt called her \"a great philosophical novelist\". James Wood wrote in How Fiction Works: \"In her literary and philosophical criticism, she again and again stresses that the creation of free and independent characters is the mark of a great novelist; yet her own characters never have this freedom.\" He stressed that some authors, \"like Tolstoy, Trollope, Balzac and Dickens\", wrote about people different from themselves by choice, whereas others, such as \"James, Flaubert, Lawrence, Woolf\", have more interest in the self. Wood called Murdoch \"poignant\", because she spent her whole life in writing in the latter category, while she struggled to fit herself into the former. In an assessment of her Booker Prize-winning novel The Sea, the Sea, Sam Jordison, creator of the poll Crap Towns, declared that the book contained \"scenes of absurd melodrama\" and \"mystical bollocks'\". He did, however, praise Murdoch's comic set pieces, and her portrayal of self-deceit. Political views Murdoch won a scholarship to study at Vassar College in the US in 1946, but was refused a visa because she had joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1938, while a student at Oxford. She left the party in 1942, when she went to work at the Treasury, but remained sympathetic to communism for several years.:\u200a172\u200a:\u200a15\u200a In later years she was allowed to visit the United States, but always had to obtain a waiver from the provisions of the McCarran Act, which barred Communist Party members and former members from entering the country. In a 1990 Paris Review interview, she said that her membership of the Communist Party had made her see \"how strong and how awful it [Marxism] is, certainly in its organized form\".:\u200a210\u200aAside from her Communist Party membership, her Irish heritage is the sensitive aspect of Murdoch's political life that seems to attract interest. Part of the interest revolves around the fact that, although Irish by both birth and traced descent on both sides, Murdoch did not display the full set of political opinions that are sometimes assumed to go with this origin: \"No one ever agrees about who is entitled to lay claim to Irishness. Iris's Belfast cousins today call themselves British, not Irish... [but] with both parents brought up in Ireland, and an ancestry within Ireland both North and South going back three centuries, Iris has as valid a claim to call herself Irish as most North Americans have to call themselves American\".:\u200a24\u200a Conradi notes A. N. Wilson's record that Murdoch regretted the sympathetic portrayal of the Irish nationalist cause she had given earlier in The Red and the Green, and a competing defence of the book at Caen in 1978.:\u200a465\u200a The novel, while broad of sympathy, is hardly an unambiguous celebration of the 1916 rising, dwelling upon bloodshed, unintended consequences and the evils of romanticism, besides celebrating selfless individuals on both sides. Later, of Ian Paisley, Murdoch stated \"[he] sincerely condemns violence and did not intend to incite the Protestant terrorists. That he is emotional and angry is not surprising, after 12\u201315 years of murderous IRA activity. All this business is deep in my soul, I'm afraid.\":\u200a465\u200a In private correspondence with her close friend and fellow philosopher Philippa Foot, she remarked in 1978 that she felt \"unsentimental about Ireland to the point of hatred\" and, of a Franco-Irish conference she had attended in Caen in 1982, said that \"the sounds of all those Irish voices made me feel privately sick. They just couldn't help sympathising with the IRA, like Americans do. A mad bad world\". Biographies and memoirs Peter J. Conradi's 2001 biography was the fruit of long research and authorised access to journals and other papers. It is also a labour of love, and of a friendship with Murdoch that extended from a meeting at her Gifford Lectures to her death. The book was well received. John Updike commented: \"There would be no need to complain of literary biographies [...] if they were all as good\". The text addresses many popular questions about Murdoch, such as how Irish she was, what her politics were, etc. Though not a trained philosopher, Conradi's interest in Murdoch's achievement as a thinker is evident in the biography, and yet more so in his earlier work of literary criticism The Saint and the Artist: A Study of Iris Murdoch's Works (Macmillan, 1986; HarperCollins, 2001). He also recalled his personal encounters with Murdoch in Going Buddhist: Panic and Emptiness, the Buddha and Me. (Short Books, 2005). Conradi's archive of material on Murdoch, together with Iris Murdoch's Oxford library, is held at Kingston University.An account of Murdoch's life with a different ambition is given by A. N. Wilson in his 2003 book Iris Murdoch as I Knew Her. The work was described by Galen Strawson in The Guardian as \"mischievously revelatory\" and labelled by Wilson himself as an \"anti-biography\". Wilson's work is an unauthorized biography. David Morgan met Iris Murdoch in 1964, when he was a student at the Royal College of Art.:\u200a475\u200a His 2010 memoir With Love and Rage: A Friendship with Iris Murdoch, describes their lifelong friendship.John Bayley wrote two memoirs of his life with Iris Murdoch. Iris: A Memoir was published in the United Kingdom in 1998, shortly before her death. The American edition, which was published in 1999, was called Elegy for Iris. A sequel entitled Iris and Her Friends was published in 1999, after her death. Murdoch was portrayed by Kate Winslet and Judi Dench in Richard Eyre's film Iris (2001), based on Bayley's memories of his wife as she developed Alzheimer's disease.In her centenary year, 2019, a collection of unpublished memoirs was published by Sabrestorm Press entitled 'Iris Murdoch: A Centenary Celebration', edited by Miles Leeson who directs the Iris Murdoch Research Centre at the University of Chichester, UK. Adaptations BBC Radio 4 broadcast in 2015 an \"Iris Murdoch season\" with several memoirs by people who knew her, and dramatisations of her novels: Iris Murdoch: Dream Girl The Sea, the Sea A Severed HeadIn March 2019, it was announced that the London-based award-winning production company Rebel Republic Films, led by director Garo Berberian, has optioned The Italian Girl (1964) and is currently developing a screenplay based on the book.

Early life Born in Vienna, Losch studied ballet from childhood at the Vienna Opera, making her debut in 1913 in Louis Frappart's 1885 Wiener Walzer. She became a member of the corps de ballet on March 1, 1918 and a coryphee three years later. Her first solo role was the Chinese Lady Doll in Josef Hassreiter's Die Puppenfee. Ballet master Heinrich Kroeller and the Opera's co-director, composer Richard Strauss, promoted her to soloist on January 1, 1924. She danced prominently in new ballets by Kroeller, Georgi Kyaksht, and Nicola Guerra. Outside the Opera, Losch took modern dance class with Grete Wiesenthal and Mary Wigman, and performed dramatic and movement roles in Viennese theaters, at the Salzburg Festival and in Max Reinhardt's 1924 Berlin production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, also choreographing the William Shakespeare play. Losch resigned from the Vienna Opera on August 31, 1927, in order to work more with Reinhardt at the Salzburg Festival and in New York City. She also choreographed Reinhardt's Everyman and Danton's Death. Losch made her London debut in 1928 in Cochran's production of No\u00ebl Coward's musical revue This Year of Grace, and over the course of the next few years, worked in London and New York as both a dancer and choreographer. In New York she danced in The Band Wagon with Fred and Adele Astaire in 1931. Reinhardt encouraged her to extend herself and believed she could also act; casting her in a 1932 London production of The Miracle, Losch's part was rewritten to provide her with the only spoken dialogue in the production (The Lord's Prayer) which she recited to dramatic effect. First marriage Losch's first husband, the Anglo-American millionaire and surrealist arts patron Edward James, founded a ballet company for her \u2013 Les Ballets 1933, which performed in London and Paris. George Balanchine, whom she had met in Berlin in 1924 and who helped her with some of her choreography, was artistic director and the entire repertory was choreographed by him. Its most popular work was The 7 Deadly Sins with Kurt Weill's music and Bertolt Brecht's text. Losch danced the leading role (a dual figure) and Lotte Lenya, with whom she had a love affair at that time, sang it. Tom Mitford (the Hon. Thomas Mitford, brother of the Mitford sisters) was described as Tilly's regular lover during this marriage. Losch was divorced by James in 1934, after being accused by him of adultery with Prince Serge Obolensky, a Russian-American hotel executive; her countersuit, in which she made it clear that her husband was homosexual, failed.A permanent reminder of Tilly Losch could be seen at Edward James' former home at Monkton, on his West Dean estate. Her \"wet\" footprints were woven into the carpet on the spiral staircase. As Tilly emerged from the bath, leaving behind a trail of wet footprints as she ascended the spiral stairs, Edward subsequently commissioned the carpet with the motif woven into it as a token of his love for her. After their divorce Edward moved the carpet to West Dean House (now West Dean College, where it can still be seen) replacing it at Monkton with a similar carpet made with his dog's footprint. Drama and film Losch extended her work into drama, and achieved her greatest popularity in England. Her stage success led her into Hollywood films. She appeared in several screen productions including Limelight (1936), The Garden of Allah (1936), The Good Earth (1937), and Duel in the Sun (1946). Her choreography was seen in Song of Scheherazade (1947). Dissatisfied with supporting film roles, she continued working as a dancer and choreographer and acted on Broadway. Losch guested with Ballet Theatre in New York in a work by Antony Tudor and in London danced L\u00e9onide Massine choreography. Her best known conception was \"The Hand Dance\" (a collaboration with her Viennese colleague, Hedy Pfundmayr) which is featured in a short dance film by Norman Bel Geddes. Prominent choreographers who made roles for Losch include Sir Frederick Ashton, Fred Astaire, George Balanchine, Heinrich Kroeller, Leonide Massine, and Anthony Tudor. Second marriage A severe clinical depression caused Losch to spend time in a sanatorium in Switzerland and abandon dance. It was during this time that she married Henry Herbert, 6th Earl of Carnarvon. The marriage was performed before opening hours in a London register office on September 1, 1939. Losch began painting, first in watercolors and then later in oils. Her earliest works were self-portraits, but she later created portraits of friends such as Anita Loos, Lotte Lenya, and Kurt Weill, and she received encouragement from Cecil Beaton. Carnarvon, aware of Losch's delicate health, sent her to the United States, where he perceived she would be safe from the growing danger of the war in Europe. She mounted her first exhibition in New York City in 1944, and was well received by critics; the prominent collector and museum founder Albert C. Barnes bought one of Losch's works from her Dutch debut show.She later combined visual elements of dance into her paintings, and often placed her subjects on a backdrop that evoked scenes of the war in Europe. As her style of painting developed she won acclaim. Her works were eventually purchased by London's Tate and other galleries. Losch's marriage to Carnarvon ended in divorce in 1947 and she commuted between London and New York City for the remainder of her life. Death Losch died from cancer in New York on December 24, 1975. Lord Carnarvon was among the many mourners at her funeral. She bequeathed many of her personal documents, sketches, paintings, and photographs to the Max Reinhardt Archives Archived June 10, 2010, at the Wayback Machine at Binghamton University, State University of New York. Tilly's ashes are interred in the grounds of Leopoldskron Castle, near Salzburg. Filmography References Sources Andrea Amort: \"Tilly Losch und Hedy Pfundmayr. Ausdruck und Verf\u00fchrung.

Career After her marriage to Lala Charat Ram, son of Lala Shri Ram, she gradually became an art patron. In 1947, upon the suggestion of Ravi Shankar, she took a loan of Rs. 10,000 from her father-in-law, and started the Jhankar Committee in Delhi. At the turn of the independence of India, princely states were abolished, which also left a large of number of musicians and dancers without patronage. Thus in the coming years, Jhankar provided patronage to leading musicians and artists of the time by organising musical concerts and dance performances. This included Siddheshwari Devi, Ravi Shankar, Hafiz Ali Khan, Baba Allaudin Khan, Shambhu Maharaj, Sunder Prasad, Birju Maharaj, Durga Lal and Aminuddin Dagar. She went on to establish Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra, a performing arts and music school in 1952, where noted gurus of the time were teachers, with noted classical singer Nilina Ripjit Singh, later known as Naina Devi, acting as its director. Throughout the 1950s, SBKK remained a focal point for the top dancers and musicians of the period, especially among leading gurus of Kathak gharanas, and Delhi became a centre of cultural revival as well new creative bursts in performing arts. The National Institute of Kathak Dance or Kathak Kendra was originally established as the Kathak wing of the Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra in 1955, and was later taken over by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama in 1964.In February 2011, the first 'Sumitra Charat Ram Award for Lifetime Achievement' established by Shri Ram Bhartiya Kala Kendra was awarded to Pandit Birju Maharaj .

Ruppelt was open-minded about UFOs, and his investigators were not known, as Grudge's were, for force-fitting explanations on cases.\"  Biography Early life and career Ruppelt was born and raised in Iowa. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps during World War II in 1942, and served with distinction as a decorated bombardier: he was awarded \"five battle stars, two theater combat ribbons, three Air Medals, and two Distinguished Flying Crosses\".After the war, Ruppelt was released into the Army reserves. He attended Iowa State College where, in 1951, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering. Shortly after finishing his education, Ruppelt was called back to active military duties after the Korean War began. He was assigned to the Air Technical Intelligence Center headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. With Blue Book When Project Grudge was ordered dissolved, Project Blue Book was developed to replace it. Lt. Col. N. R. Rosengarten asked Ruppelt to take over as the new project's leader, partly because Ruppelt \"had a reputation as a good organizer\", and had helped get other wayward projects back on track. Though he was initially scheduled to stay with Blue Book for only a few months, when Project Grudge was reorganized in late 1951 and renamed Project Blue Book, Ruppelt (then a captain) was kept on as director. Ruppelt wrote that the Air Force's initial approach to the UFO question \"was tackled with organized confusion.\" In defending General Samford's press conference on 29 July 1952, immediately after the big UFO flap at Washington National Airport, Ruppelt wrote that \"his [Samford's] people had fouled up in not fully investigating the sightings.\" Astronomer and Blue Book consultant J. Allen Hynek thought that Ruppelt did his best, only to see his efforts stymied. Hynek wrote \"In my contacts with [Ruppelt] I found him to be honest and seriously puzzled about the whole phenomenon\". After Blue Book Ruppelt requested reassignment from Blue Book in late 1953 shortly after the Robertson Panel issued its conclusions (based partly on the panel's official report, Ruppelt's Blue Book staff was reduced from more than ten personnel to three, including Ruppelt). He retired from the Air Force not long afterwards, then worked in the aerospace industry. In 1956, he worked as a research engineer for Northrop Aircraft Company, according to publisher information in the online version of his 1956 book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects. Hynek suggested that Ruppelt's \"book should be required reading for anyone seriously interested in the history of this subject\". In the book, Ruppelt detailed his time with Projects Grudge and Blue Book, and offered his assessments of some UFO cases. In 1956, Donald Keyhoe asked Ruppelt to join to serve as an adviser to the newly created National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) . Ruppelt had recently suffered a heart attack, and declined Keyhoe's offer. Ruppelt's book indicates that he held some dim views of Keyhoe and his early writings; Ruppelt stated that while Keyhoe generally had his facts straight, his interpretation of those facts was another question entirely. He thought Keyhoe often sensationalized the material and accused Keyhoe of \"mind reading\" what he and other officers were thinking. In what would turn out to be a matter of months before his death, Ruppelt came out with an expanded (20-chapter) edition of his book - as published by Doubleday & Co. In new chapters notably conservative in tone, and frequently attributed by reviewers to author disillusionment or disenchantment, Ruppelt declared UFOs a \"space age myth\". Content of this nature was of a noticeably different tone to famous quotes from the original \"Report\" that had, for example, referred critically to a 1949 change of attitude in the Project whereby: \"everything was being evaluated on the premise UFO's couldn't exist. No matter what you see or hear, don't believe it\". Ruppelt had also been prompted to write back in 1956: \"This period of \"mind changing\" bothered me\", and \"this change in the operating policy of the UFO project was so pronounced that, I like so many other people, wondered if there was a hidden reason for the change. Was it actually an attempt to go underground - to make the project more secretive?\" Death In what one paper rerred to as a \"sudden\" death, Ruppelt succumbed to a heart attack on September 15, 1960, at the age of 37. He was survived by mother Mrs Bessie Ruppelt, wife Elizabeth Anne, and daughters aged 9 and 4. References Notes Bibliography External links Media related to Edward J.

Of the three, Way Down East, produced in 1898, was the most successful, proving to be one of the most popular American plays of its time, steadily performed for two decades.  Early years Born 1858, in Oswego, New York, Charlotte Blair Parker was the daughter of George and Emily Hitchcock Blair. Career Charlotte \"Lottie\" Blair Parker's theatrical career started as an actress, studying for the stage under the noted Shakespearian actor, Wyzeman Marshall in Boston. She performed with the stock company of the Boston Theatre, and later toured with such major figures as the Czech tragic actress Mme. Janauschek and American actor-producer of poetic drama Lawrence Barrett. She married a theatrical manager, Harry D. Parker. She turned to playwriting when White Roses, a one-act play she submitted to a New York Herald contest in 1892, received honorable mention. Way Down East In 1897, at the age of 39, Parker penned her most popular full-length play, titled Way Down East. It was a sentimental melodrama about the travails of a seduced woman, Anna Moore, who is cast out by those who learn her story. After being seduced and losing the child of that liaison, Anna Moore (Phoebe Davies) wanders despondently until she finds refuge as a servant in the New England farm of Squire Bartlett (played by Odell Williams). Ignorant of her past, the Bartletts embrace her as part of their household. But when Squire Bartlett learns her history he drives her from his home in the midst of a raging snowstorm. Anna loses her way and nearly dies before she is rescued by the Bartletts' son, David (played by Howard Kyle). He has come to love her and finally persuades his parents that she is worthy to be his wife. Way Down East premiered at the Manhattan Theatre in 1898 where it enjoyed 152 performances. It was later revised by Joseph R. Grismer, whose wife, Phoebe Davis, played the leading role of Anna Moore in the original production and in later revivals in 1903 and 1905. Davis would go on to play the role for more than 4,000 performances.In 1920 D. W. Griffith paid $175,000 for screen rights to the melodrama, which was by then considered dated. His film version was a popular success and an artistic triumph, largely because of the sweetly expressive face of Lillian Gish.Critics saw a strong resemblance between Way Down East and Steele MacKaye's 1880 melodrama Hazel Kirke, in which Parker had once played the title role. Both plays feature an innocent girl who loves a man above her station in life and is duped by a sham marriage ceremony. Upon her learning of her dishonor, Hazel Kirke throws herself into the mill race. In Way Down East, Anna Moore is sent out into a New England blizzard. In both plays, the heroine is rescued at the last minute and a reconciliation is effected. The originality of Parker's treatment lies in her use of \"Down East\" atmosphere and such comic characters as Hi Holler, Martha Perkins, and Reuben Whipple. Under Southern Skies Under Southern Skies was set in Louisiana in 1875. It opened November 12, 1901, with Grace George in the leading role. True to its reviewer's prediction, the play was a popular success with \"that large class of playgoers who like their color on thick without too much delicacy of shading, and with no great subtlety in the handling.\" This criticism was intended metaphorically, but it might also be noted that several roles were performed in black-face. As in Way Down East, the heroine is caught between a false-hearted cad and an honorable young suitor; again, virtue triumphs. A film version, directed by Lucius Henderson and starring Mary Fuller, was produced and released by the Universal Film Manufacturing Company in 1915. The Redemption of David Corson Parker's third full-length play to reach Broadway was The Redemption of David Corson, based upon a novel of the same title by Charles Frederic Goss. It premiered January 8, 1906, but had a short life of only 16 performances. In 1909, Parker focused on the New England village milieu, Yankee characters, and rustic dialect, when she turned the novel Homespun: A Story of Some New England Folk into a stage play. She used the formula of her stage melodramas\u2014a conflict between a rich scoundrel and a poor-but-honest young man. A review of Homespun in The New York Times (14 Aug. 1909) sums up her characteristic manner: \"It is as moral as a Sunday school tale, and at the end pleases if not surprises the reader by the tableau of virtue triumphant and vice in the dust.\" Death Charlotte Blair Parker died January 5, 1937, in Great Neck, New York.

She published a biography and two novels, in addition to numerous articles. Davis died from an infectious disease at age 34.  Childhood Varina Anne \"Winnie\" Davis was born one year before the end of the American Civil War in the White House of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia. She was the second daughter and the sixth child of Varina Banks (Howell) Davis and Jefferson F. Davis. The youngest, she was the only child of the family who was allowed to visit her father in Fort Monroe with her mother during his two years of imprisonment that followed the Civil War. They eventually were given an apartment in the officers' quarters to use. Winnie was home-educated by her parents in her early years. She later accompanied her parents on their numerous journeys. At the age of thirteen, she was sent to the Misses Friedl\u00e4nders School in Karlsruhe, Germany. She studied for five years in the renowned boarding school, in that time acquiring a slight German accent. Later, she studied in Paris for a short while before returning to the United States. Daughter of the Confederacy During the 1880s, Winnie lived with her parents at Beauvoir, their Gulf Coast estate near Biloxi, Mississippi. It was bequeathed to Jefferson Davis in 1878 by Sarah Anne Ellis Dorsey, a wealthy widow and supporter of the Confederacy. In 1886, Winnie and her aging father visited West Point, Georgia, on a tour of the South promoting his books and the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. On April 24, 1886, Governor John Brown Gordon called Davis \"The Daughter of the Confederacy\". This title stuck, and Winnie became an icon for Confederate veteran groups and an inspiration for the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which formed in 1894. Together with her father, she made public appearances and speeches, and acted more and more as his representative. Confederate groups, including women's associations, worked to fund and organize cemeteries, memorialize the war and its soldiers, and honor the \"Lost Cause\" of the South.In 1888, Winnie published her first book, a monograph of Irish revolutionary Robert Emmet titled An Irish Knight of the 19th Century. Davis was involved in a few well-known romantic relationships, but she never married. In 1885\u20131886, she may have been courted by the noted landscape and portrait artist Verner Moore White, but the relationship supposedly ended when White moved to Europe to further his studies in art. This relationship has never been completely verified.In 1887, Davis developed a more serious relationship with Alfred Wilkinson, a successful New York attorney, whom she met while staying with family friends in Syracuse, New York during the late fall of 1886. Her mother met Wilkinson and initially approved the match, but her father disapproved, based on Wilkinson being from the North and his grandfather having been an abolitionist. Davis reconsidered his disapproval after meeting Wilkinson, and the engagement of the couple was announced in 1889. Northern papers publicized it as healing the wounds of the Civil War. However, an outcry against it in the Southern United States burdened the romance, for some dreamed that the young Davis would marry a prominent Southerner, preferably a descendant of one of the generals. Jefferson Davis died shortly before the announced wedding date, and mourning custom required postponing the nuptials for a year. During this time, Wilkinson's house burned down. Winnie's mother Varina became opposed to the marriage. Her Southern friends considered the relationship an insult to the Davis legacy. More importantly, her husband had left the widowed Varina in financial difficulties, and she worried that Wilkinson would be unable to support Winnie. This concern was incorrect, but the damage was done. The engagement was ended in October 1890.By 1891, Varina Davis moved with her daughter to New York City, deeming the climate of Mississippi unhealthy. Richmond, Virginia had offered them a home, but both women realized they needed to work to support themselves financially. The widowed Varina had no pension, nor signing authority with respect to what remained of Davis's estate. Mother and daughter both became correspondents for the New York World, a newspaper owned by Joseph Pulitzer, a good friend of the Davis family who was married to Kate Pulitzer, a distant Davis cousin and friend of Varina's. The Davis women lived in a series of residential hotels, eventually settling at the Gerard Hotel in what is now the theater district.During this time, Davis also wrote for national magazines, such as The Ladies Home Journal. She published two novels: The Veiled Doctor: A Novel (reprinted 2015) and a A Romance of Summer Seas (1898, reprinted 2009). Both books were moderately successful. Death In July 1898, Winnie Davis became deathly ill. She had been soaked in a rainstorm at a Confederate Veterans' Reunion in Atlanta, Georgia, then traveled by train to meet her mother in Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island. They vacationed there annually in the summer at the fashionable Rockingham Hotel. Doctors diagnosed Davis with \"malarial gastritis\". She had already suffered for years from gastritis. (It has been associated with bacterial infection.) Davis suffered for weeks from fever, chills, and loss of appetite. The Rockingham Hotel closed for the season in early September, but the management allowed Davis and her mother to stay on. Davis died there on September 18, 1898. She was 34 years old. Her mother arranged for her daughter to be buried in Richmond's Hollywood Cemetery, with military honors because of her service to Confederate veterans' groups. She was next to the graves of her father and brothers, who had been reinterred here.Davis was survived by her mother Varina and by her sister Margaret (Davis) Addison Hayes, then living in Colorado Springs, Colorado with her husband Joel Addison Hayes, and her sister's children. Among their several children was a daughter, Varina Howell Davis Hayes. The youngest Varina later married Gerald Bertram Webb. Among their children was daughter named Varina Margaret Webb.

Early life Oz\u00e1miz was born on May 5, 1898 in house near the \u201cold bridge\u201d in Moran to Jenaro Oz\u00e1miz from Navarre, Spain and Basilisa Fortich, a Filipino mestizo of Spanish and Cebuano ancestry. Jenaro left Spain at age sixteen and came to Moran, then ended up at the Municipality of Jimenez and engaged in the business of abac\u00e1 and copra trading which made him very rich, acquiring through the years 3.55 km2 (1.37 sq mi) in tile province and 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi) ranch in Bukidnon. Jos\u00e9 spoke his first languages Spanish, Cebuano, Tagalog and English when Philippines came under American rule.He was the oldest and the only son among ten children.

He went back to Manila in February 1944. He was arrested by Japanese Kempetai on February 11 on his wife's birthday. He was condemned to be executed. A Filipino nicknamed \"makapili\" played a part in his downfall along with twenty-nine other fellow Filipino who also got arrested at the same time. They were the core of the guerilla movement in Manila. On the same day, he was beheaded at the Manila North Cemetery, alongside 29 guerilla members, by the Japanese during their occupation of the Philippines during World War II for his involvement in the Resistance Movement. Legacy The city of Ozamiz (which used to be called Misamis) in the province of Misamis Occidental was posthumously named in his honor.

Background Hallie Flanagan was born in Redfield, South Dakota. When she was around 10, her family moved to Grinnell, Iowa. She attended Grinnell College where she majored in Philosophy and German, and was an active member in the Literary and Dramatic Clubs. During her time at Grinnell she became friends with Harry Hopkins, who had also grown up in Grinnell and was a year behind her at Grinnell College. It was this connection that would be instrumental in her later position in the WPA Federal Theatre Project. She graduated from Grinnell in 1911. It was during college that she met her husband, Murray Flanagan, who was also a member of the Grinnell Dramatic Club. After college, the two exchanged vows, and had two sons, Jack and Frederick Flanagan. Murray was diagnosed with tuberculosis; the disease took his life in 1919. Soon after, in 1922, the elder son, Jack, died of spinal meningitis. Hallie and Frederick moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts where she enrolled in George Pierce Baker's famous 47 Workshop dramatic production studio at Radcliffe College\/Harvard University. This class, one of the first of its kind at an American university, taught playwrighting. Baker was so impressed with her, he decided to make her the director of the workshop's actors' group in 1923. While at Radcliffe and later at Vassar College, Flanagan began developing her own ideas for experimental theatre. Career Vassar College When Flanagan came to Vassar, there was no theater and all drama courses were taught in the English department. Flanagan's official title at the school was \"Director of English Speech\". In 1926, Flanagan became the first woman awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to study theatre around Europe for 14 months. While there, she met some of the most influential figures in theatre including John Galsworthy, Konstantin Stanislavsky, Edward Gordon Craig and Lady Gregory. Flanagan especially shared a connection with the Russian theater, and later wrote a book, Shifting Scenes of the Modern European Theater (1928), based on her travels. After returning to Vassar, she began to institute many of her newly developed ideas with the Vassar Experimental Theatre, which she created. The first play she produced was Anton Chekhov's Marriage Proposal, using the original Chekhov style, an expressionistic style, and Meyerhold's constructivist techniques throughout the three acts. Over the years, she pushed the administration to start an independent major in drama, but it wasn't approved until after Flanagan had left. Flanagan rose to national prominence after producing the theatrical adaptation she co-wrote, Can You Hear Their Voices?, based on the short story written by Whittaker Chambers for The New Masses in 1931. Federal Theatre Project With the onset of the Great Depression, and masses of people (including the theatrically inclined) out of work, Franklin D. Roosevelt established the WPA to provide jobs for many of the unemployed. Among the many branches of this program was the Federal Theatre Project, which aimed to employ the jobless entertainers across America. In September 1935, WPA head Harry Hopkins, who knew Flanagan from Grinnell College and had read Flanagan's 1928 book, Shifting Scenes of the European Theatre, asked Flanagan to lead the Project.Flanagan's vision for the Project was to bring cutting-edge, high-quality theatre to the great majority of the American public who had never witnessed it. The project paid salaries to struggling artists and crafts workers, and spread well-crafted, affordable programs across the nation. The Project involved creating children's theatre as well as Living Newspaper plays, based on German director Erwin Piscator's concepts, that would reach out to the culturally unaware. Though the Project enabled the creation of a number of works, conservatives took issue with the apparent political agendas being delivered by the plays. Concerns over works with messages deemed to be communistic and socialistic plagued Flanagan and the Theatre Project. On these qualms, Flanagan states, \"The basis of the choice of plays is that we have always believed in the Federal Theatre Project that any theater supported by the Federal funds should do no plays of a subversive, or cheap, or shoddy, or vulgar, or outworn, or imitative nature, but only such plays as the Government could stand behind in a program which is national in scope and regional in emphasis and democratic in American attitude.\" By 1936, Flanagan had hired 12,500 people across 28 states. In New York City alone, the Federal Theatre Project regularly played to weekly audiences of 350,000. Since the plays were federally funded, the Project could afford to sell tickets at drastically reduced prices, making the productions accessible and inclusive to a wider audience. In 1938, Flanagan was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee under suspicion of supporting a socialist agenda and subverting American values through her work at the Federal Theatre Project. After just four years, the Federal Theatre Project was shut down, and Flanagan returned to Vassar. Smith College In 1942, Flanagan accepted Smith College's offer to serve as Dean of the College, and as a professor in the Theater Department. She resigned from her position as Dean in 1946 so that she could focus on the Theater Department, of which she was the chair of the department. She also wrote and directed productions put on at the college and director of productions put on at the college. She retired from Smith in 1955. In 1962, the Studio Theater in Smith's new Center for the Performing Arts was named in her honor. Other details Flanagan's first husband, Murray Flanagan, died in 1918 from tuberculosis, they had two sons. In 1934, she married Philip Davis, a professor of Greek at Vassar. In Tim Robbins' Cradle Will Rock (1999), Cherry Jones played Hallie Flanagan. She is also a minor character in the novel The Group, by Vassar grad Mary McCarthy, being mentioned in the first chapter and appearing briefly in the last chapter. Flanagan went on leave from Smith in 1953 and officially retired to Poughkeepsie in 1955. She was recognized many times for her contributions to modern theater, including an honorary degree from Williams College in 1941 and the first National Theater Conference Citation award in 1968. Flanagan spent the last few years of her life in nursing homes and died on July 23, 1969 in Old Tappan, N.J. See also Can You Hear Their Voices?

She is best known for her debut album Hinda, that charted at #20 on the 1998 UK Top 40 Chart, and led to three nominations in the MOBO Awards and nominations for Best British Female Artist and Best British Newcomer at the 1999 Brit Awards.  Introduction Hicks was born in Tunisia but was raised in West Sussex, where she soon emerged as \"one of the U.K.'s most promising talents\". Before her musical career, she had a passion for basketball, which resulted in a coaching qualification, as well as a United States scholarship. However, her sights set on music after her friend overheard her singing along to an Aretha Franklin track, thus encouraging her to sing.Artists like Ella Fitzgerald and Nina Simone helped to shape the roots of Hicks' musical career, which she later describes in an interview with Ras Kwame as \"the balance between my love of hip hop, my love of jazz, my love of soul\". She began to sing with an R&B group called the Fabulous Fug Band and, at one time, sent a demo of her own vocals alongside Aretha Franklin's \"Something He Can Feel\" to Phil Collins. However, she continued to remain unsigned and moved to London, where she worked as a secretary and joined the band Mixed Fruits. Early success Hicks was introduced to On Point Productions, the team comprising Jazz Black (music producer) and Dele Rotimi (music manager), which put her on the radar for multiple record companies. In 1997, she signed a five-album deal with Island Records. However, her first single \"I Wanna Be Your Lady\" did not make the UK Singles Chart. After performing \"high-profile support slots\" with Irish boyband Boyzone and English group 911, Hicks' next three singles all reached the Top 40. \"If You Want Me\" reached #25, \"You Think You Own Me\" ranked #19, and a re-release of \"I Wanna Be Your Lady\" topped #14 on the charts.After Hick's debut album Hinda charted at #20, Hick's received 3 nominations at the 1998 MOBO Awards and also nominations for Best British Female and Best British Newcomer at the 1999 Brit Awards. Later in the year, Hicks fourth Top 40 single \"Truly\" reached #31 on the charts. Second album After the 1999 Brit Awards, Hicks spent the next year recording her second album Everything to Me. She had split from her management and production team that discovered her - On Point Productions. However, due to the Island Records and Universal Records merger and a lack of promotion, her single \"My Remedy\" was unable to make the UK Top 40. While Hicks' second album received limited release, the launch was aborted commercially and she and Island Records parted ways in 2000. In between record companies and albums, Hicks recorded vocals on other artists' tracks and musical projects. This included \"Let's Do It Again\" with the late Lynden David Hall, which featured on his album The Other Side, as well as the compilation album Pure R&B Volume 2. Hicks was also featured in \"Brand New Day\" from Terri Walker's debut album Untitled, which released on 3 March 2003 with Mercury Records. Third album and the future Hicks returned to music production in 2004, with the release of her third album Still Doin' My Thing under the R&B label Shout Out Records. The single \"Up Up\" was released in the summer of 2004, but she was unable to repeat her earlier success of making the UK Top 40 Chart. In February 2007, Hicks' MySpace page announced that a fourth album would be released in 2010, however the album was shelved as Hicks focused on other roles. As of November 2008, Hicks was listed as part of a London-based artistic and music collective created by the DJ and producer Yvan Healer Selecta and called Raison d'Etre [sic]. Critical acclaim In October 1998, Hicks was nominated for three MOBO awards: Best R'n'B Act, Best Newcomer and Best Album. She also appeared on a MOBO Allstars charity single called \"Aint No Stopping Us Now\". In early 1999, Hicks was nominated at the BRIT Awards in the categories of 'Best Newcomer' and 'Best British Female Artist'. Other work Film Hicks has appeared in two British film productions: G:MT - Greenwich Mean Time in 1999 (for which she performed several of the songs on the official soundtrack) and Circus in 2000. Hicks took an uncredited role in a well-received US film Love & Basketball in 2000 and wrote the song \"Our Destiny\" that appeared in the movie but was not featured on the soundtrack. The track did, however, feature on the Everything to Me album, which was not released in the UK.

Katsina State governor In the December 1991 elections for governor of Katsina State, Barda defeated Umaru Yar'Adua, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) candidate. Yar'Adua later went on to be elected president in April 2007. Umaru's elder brother General Shehu Yar'Adua, then a prominent politician with presidential ambitions, had failed to give his full backing to Umaru's bid. Barda was favored by the military president at the time, General Ibrahim Babangida.Barda completed construction of a flour mill in Katsina, initiated in 1981, but later abandoned. In June 1993, Barda set up a committee on the Rehabilitation of Education \"to look into the educational decadence in schools ... and proffer solutions.\" He also laid the foundation for the Othman Dan Fodio Institute, intended to be the first Islamic university in Nigeria but later abandoned. Barda supported Babangida's annulment of the 12 June 1993 election of MKO Abiola as president, saying \"blood will flow on an unprecedented scale\" if the annulment were to be reversed. The political struggles that followed the annulment led to the coup in which General Sani Abacha took power in November 1993, when all elected governors were dismissed.

Early life Arphexad was born in Les Abymes, Guadeloupe. Club career Arphexad began in the French League with Lens and played in the last three matches of the 1995\u201396 Division 1. The next season, he played in two league matches on loan for Lille. Leicester City In August 1997, Arphexad began his time in the Premier League with Leicester City. During Leicester's successful 1999\u20132000 League Cup campaign he started ahead of Tim Flowers and saved two crucial penalties in a penalty shootout against Fulham in the quarter final. He earned his first ever winner's medal as an unused substitute in the final. In that season he also came on as a substitute for the injured Flowers in Leicester's penalty shootout win over Arsenal in an FA Cup fourth round replay, saving penalties from Lee Dixon and Gilles Grimandi as Leicester progressed. Arphexad played a big role in Liverpool's failure to qualify for the UEFA Champions League in 1999\u20132000. He produced an inspired performance to deny the Reds a much needed three points at Anfield in May 2000. His heroics that night clearly impressed G\u00e9rard Houllier, who moved swiftly to sign Arphexad on a free transfer under the Bosman ruling during the summer. Arphexad claimed that he would have stayed at Leicester had he been guaranteed a role as the first choice keeper, but the arrival of Flowers after the departure of Kasey Keller meant that he felt that he had the option of being a backup at a mid-table club or a backup at a club challenging for the title. Liverpool Arphexad won six medals with Liverpool, all as an unused substitute. These included three in Liverpool's treble winning 2000\u201301 season, where they won the FA Cup, the Football League Cup and the UEFA Cup. Two subsequent medals followed the following season as Liverpool claimed both the Charity Shield and the European Super Cup. In the 2001\u201302 season, he was the starting goalkeeper in the opening match that ended in a 2-1 win against West Ham United. His second and last league appearance for Liverpool was on 9 February 2002 in a 6-0 win against Ipswich Town, replacing Jerzy Dudek during the second half.Arphexad earned a second League Cup winners medal in the 2002\u201303 season and was released by Liverpool that summer, later having spells with Coventry City and Notts County. He also rejected a move to Chester City claiming that he would not be prepared to join a club playing lower than the second division. International career Arphexad made one appearance for the France national under-21 team in 1994. After football Rumours surfaced online that Arphexad turned to making pornographic content after a failed career in acting. However, in an interview with the Leicester Mercury, he stated the rumours were not true, whilst going on to say that he now works in sports insurance. He is currently works for Henner Sports as a European Business Officer.

Udet grew up in Munich, and was known from his early childhood for his sunny temperament and fascination with aviation. In his youth he hung out at a nearby airplane factory and an army airship detachment. In 1909, he helped found the Munich Aero-Club. After crashing a glider he and a friend constructed, he finally flew in 1913 with a test pilot in the nearby Otto Works owned by Gustav Otto, which he often visited. Military career World War I Shortly after the beginning of World War I, Udet attempted to enlist in the Imperial German Army on 2 August 1914, but at only 160 cm (5 ft 3.0 in) tall he did not then qualify for enlistment. Later that month, when the Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club appealed for volunteers with motorcycles, Udet applied and was accepted. Udet's father had given him a motorcycle when he had passed his first year examination, and along with four friends, Udet was posted to the 26. W\u00fcrttembergischen Reserve Division as a \"messenger rider.\" After injuring his shoulder when his motorcycle hit a crater from an artillery shell explosion, he was sent to a military hospital, and his motorcycle was sent for repairs. When Udet tried to track down the 26th Division, he was unable to find it and decided to serve in the vehicle depot in Namur. During this time, he met officers from the Chauny flying sector, who advised him to transfer as an aerial observer. However, before he received his orders, the army dispensed with the volunteer motorcyclists, and Udet was sent back to the recruiting officials.Udet tried to return to the fighting, but he was unable to get into either the pilot or aircraft mechanic training the army offered. However, he learned that if he were a trained pilot, he would be immediately accepted into army aviation. Through a family friend, Gustav Otto, owner of the aircraft factory he had hung out around in his youth, Udet received private flight training. This cost him 2,000 Deutsche Marks (about $400 in 1915 U.S. dollars) and new bathroom equipment from his father's firm. Udet received his civilian pilot's license at the end of April 1915 and was immediately accepted by the Imperial German Air Service. Artillery ranging Udet at first flew in Feld Flieger-Abteilung 206 (FFA 206)\u2014an observation unit\u2014as an Unteroffizier (non-commissioned) pilot with observer Leutnant Bruno Justinius. He and his observer won the Iron Cross (2nd class for Udet and 1st class for his lieutenant) for nursing their damaged Aviatik B.I two-seater back to German lines after a shackle on a wing-cable snapped. Justinius had climbed out to hold the wing and balance it rather than landing behind the enemy lines and being captured. After the structural failure of the Aviatik that caused Udet and Justinius to go down, and a similar incident in which Leutnant Winter and Vizefeldwebel Preiss lost their lives, the Aviatik B was retired from active service.Later, Udet was court-martialed for losing an aircraft in an incident the flying corps considered a result of bad judgement. Overloaded with fuel and bombs, the aircraft stalled after a sharp bank and plunged to the ground. Miraculously, both Udet and Justinius survived with only minor injuries. Udet was placed under arrest in the guardhouse for seven days. On his way out of the guardhouse, he was asked to fly Leutnant Hartmann to observe a bombing raid on Belfort. A bomb thrown by hand by the leutnant became stuck in the landing gear, but Udet performed aerobatics and managed to shake it loose. As soon as the Air Staff Officer heard about Udet's performance during the incident, he ordered Udet transferred to the fighter command. Fighter pilot Udet was assigned a new Fokker to fly to his new fighter unit\u2014FFA 68\u2014at Habsheim. Mechanically defective, the plane crashed into a hangar when he took off, so he was then given an older Fokker to fly. In this aircraft, he experienced his first aerial combat, which almost ended in disaster. While lining up on a French Caudron, Udet found he could not bring himself to fire on another person and was subsequently fired on by the Frenchman. A bullet grazed his cheek and smashed his flying goggles. Udet survived the encounter, but from then on learned to attack aggressively and began scoring victories, downing his first French opponent on 18 March 1916. On that occasion, he had scrambled to attack two French aircraft, but instead found himself facing a formation of 23 enemy aircraft. He dived from above and behind, giving his Fokker E.III full throttle, and opened fire on a Farman F.40 from close range. Udet pulled away, leaving the flaming bomber trailing smoke, only to see the observer fall from the rear seat of the stricken craft. He later described the incident: \"The fuselage of the Farman dives down past me like a giant torch... A man, his arms and legs spread out like a frog's, falls past--the observer. At the moment, I don't think of them as human beings. I feel only one thing--victory, triumph, victory.\" The victory won Udet the Iron Cross First Class. That year, FFA 68 was renamed Kampfeinsitzer Kommando Habsheim before becoming Jagdstaffel 15 on 28 September 1916. Udet claimed five more victories, before transferring to Jasta 37 in June 1917. In the first of his victories on 12 October 1916, Udet forced a French Breguet to land safely in German territory, then landed nearby to prevent its destruction by its crew. The bullet-punctured tires on Udet's Fokker flipped the plane forward onto its top wings and fuselage. Udet and the French pilot eventually shook hands next to the Frenchman's aircraft. In January 1917, Udet was commissioned as a Leutnant der Reserve (lieutenant of reserves). The same month, Jasta 15 re-equipped with the Albatros D.III, a new fighter with twin synchronized Maschinengewehr 08 machine guns.On August 15, 1917 he shot down his 8th victory-a Sopwith Strutter 1\/2 of 43d Squadron RFC.During his service with Jasta 15, Udet later wrote he had encountered Georges Guynemer, a notable French ace, in single combat at 5,000 m (16,000 ft). Guynemer, who preferred to hunt enemy planes alone, by this time was the leading French ace with more than 30 victories. Udet saw Guynemer and they circled each other, looking for an opening and testing each other's turning abilities. They were close enough for Udet to read the \"Vieux\" of \"Vieux Charles\" written on Guynemer's Spad S.VII. The opponents tried every aerobatic trick they knew and Guynemer fired a burst through Udet's upper wing, however maneuvered for advantage. Once Udet had Guynemer in his sights, his machine guns jammed and while pretending to dogfight he pounded on them with his fists, desperate to unjam them. Guynemer realized his predicament and instead of taking advantage of it, simply waved a farewell and flew away. Udet wrote of the fight, \"For seconds, I forgot that the man across from me was Guynemer, my enemy. It seems as though I were sparring with an older comrade over our own airfield.\" Udet felt that Guynemer had spared him because he wanted a fair fight, while others have suggested that Guynemer had a gun jam himself, feared that Udet would ram him in desperation, or the French ace was so impressed with Udet's skills that he hoped they might meet again on equal terms. Eventually, every pilot in Jasta 15 was killed except Udet and his commander, Heinrich Gontermann, who said to Udet: \"The bullets fall from the hand of God ... Sooner or later they will hit us.\" Udet applied for a transfer to Jasta 37, and Gontermann was killed three months later when the upper wing of his new Fokker Dr. 1 tore off as he was flying it for the first time. Gontermann lingered for twenty four hours without awakening and Udet later remarked, \"It was a good death.\" By late November, Udet was a triple ace and Jastaf\u00fchrer, modelling his attacks after those of Guynemer, coming in high out of the sun to pick off the rear aircraft in a squadron before the others knew what was happening. Having witnessed one of these attacks, his commander in Jasta 37 Kurt Grasshoff, on being transferred, selected Udet for command over more senior men. Udet's ascension to command on 7 November 1917, was followed six days later by award of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. Despite his seemingly frivolous nature, drinking late into the night, and womanizing lifestyle, Udet proved an excellent squadron commander. He spent many hours coaching new fighter pilots, with an emphasis on marksmanship as being essential for success. The Flying Circus Udet's success attracted attention for his skill, earning him an invitation to join the \"Flying Circus\", Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1), an elite unit of German fighter aces under the command of Manfred von Richthofen, popularly known as the Red Baron. Richthofen drove up to Udet one day as he was trying to pitch a tent in Flanders in the rain, pointing out that Udet had 20 kills, Richthofen said, \"Then you would actually seem ripe for us. Would you like to?\", which Udet accepted. After watching him shoot down an artillery spotter by frontal attack, Richthofen gave Udet command of Jasta 11, von Richthofen's former squadron command. The group commanded by Richthofen also contained Jastas 4, 6 and 10. Udet's enthusiasm for Richthofen was unbounded, who demanded total loyalty and dedication from his pilots, immediately cashiering anyone who fell out of line. At the same time, Richthofen treated them with every consideration and when it came time to requisition supplies he traded favors for autographed photos of himself that read: \"Dedicated to my esteemed fighting companion.\" Udet remarked that because of the signed photographs, \" ... sausage and ham never ran out.\" One night, the squadron invited a captured English flyer for dinner, treating him as a guest. When he excused himself for the bathroom, the Germans secretly watched to see if he would try to escape. On his return the Englishman said, \"I would never forgive myself for disappointing such hosts\"; the English flyer did escape later from another unit. Richthofen was killed in April 1918 in France, where Udet was not at the front as he had been sent on leave due to a painful ear infection which he avoided having treated as long as he could. Udet said about Richthofen: \"He was the least complicated man I ever knew. Entirely Prussian and the greatest of soldiers.\" before returning to JG 1 against the doctor's advice and remained there to the end of the war, commanding Jasta 4. While at home, Udet had reacquainted himself with his childhood sweetheart, Eleanor \"Lo\" Zink. Notified that he had received the Pour le M\u00e9rite, he had one made up in advance so that he could impress her, and painted her name on the side of his Albatros fighters and Fokker D VII. Also on the tail of his Fokker D VII was the message \"Du doch nicht\" - \"Definitely not you.\" Udet scored 20 victories in August 1918 alone, mainly against British aircraft and became a national hero with 62 confirmed victories to his credit.On 29 June 1918, Udet was one of the early fliers to be saved by parachuting from a disabled aircraft, when he jumped after a clash with a French Breguet. His harness caught on the rudder and he had to break off the rudder tip to escape. His parachute did not open until he was 75 m (250 ft) from the ground, causing him to sprain his ankle on landing. On 28 September 1918, Udet was wounded in the thigh, for which he was still recovering on Armistice Day, 11 November 1918, when the war ended in Germany's defeat. Inter-war period After the war, on his way home from the military hospital, Udet had to defend himself against a Communist who wished to rip the medals off his chest. Udet and Robert Ritter von Greim performed mock dogfights at weekends for the POW Relief Organization, using surplus aircraft in Bavaria. He was invited to start the first International Air Service between Germany and Austria, but after the first flight the Entente Commission confiscated his aircraft. Udet married Eleanor \"Lo\" Zink on 25 February 1920, however the marriage lasted less than three years and they were divorced on 16 February 1923. The marriage is believed to have ended due to Udet having had many affairs. His talents were numerous - among these were juggling, drawing cartoons, and party entertainment. During the inter-war period, Udet was known primarily for his work as a stunt pilot and for playboy-like behavior. He flew for movies and for airshows (e.g. picking a cloth from the ground with his wingtip, flying under low bridges and completing loops only several meters from the ground). One stunt only Udet performed was successive loops with the last complete after turning off the engine mid air and landing the aircraft in a sideways glide. He appeared with Leni Riefenstahl in three films: The White Hell of Pitz Palu (1929), St\u00fcrme \u00fcber dem Mont Blanc (1930), and S.O.S. Eisberg (1933). Udet's stunt pilot work in films took him to California. In the October 1933 issue of New Movie Magazine, there is a photo of Carl Laemmle, Jr.'s party for Udet in Hollywood. Laemmle was head of Universal Studios which made SOS Eisberg, a US-German co-production. Udet was invited to attend the National Air Races at Cleveland, Ohio. In 1935 he played himself in Miracle of Flight (1935; 79 mins.) directed by Heinz Paul. His co-star J\u00fcrgen Ohlsen, who had previously starred in the extremely popular film Hitlerjunge Quex: Ein Film vom Opfergeist der deutschen Jugend, played a youth who lost his pilot father in World War I and was befriended and encouraged by Udet, his idol. In the Berlin 1936 Summer Olympics Udet entered the arts competition literature category with his autobiography, Mein Fliegerleben (My Flying Life) (published 1935). These efforts were good publicity for Udet. An American, William Pohl of Milwaukee, telephoned him with an offer to back an aircraft manufacturing company. Udet Flugzeugbau was born in a shed in Milbertshofen. Its intent was to build small aircraft that the general public could fly. It soon ran into trouble with the Entente Commission and transferred its operations to a beehive and chicken coop factory.The first aeroplane that Udet's company produced was the U2. Udet took the second model, the U4, to the Wilbur Cup race in Buenos Aires at the expense of Aero Club Aleman. It was outclassed, and the club wanted him to do cigarette commercials to reimburse them for the expense, but he refused. He was rescued by the Chief of the Argentinian Railways, a man of Swedish descent named Tornquist, who settled the debt.In 1924, Udet left Udet Flugzeugbau when they decided to build a four-engine aircraft, the U11 Kondor which was larger and not for the general population. He and another friend from the war, Angermund, started an exhibition flying enterprise in Germany, which was also successful, but Udet remarked, \"In time this too begins to get tiresome. ... We stand in the present, fighting for a living. It isn't always easy. ... But the thoughts wander back to the times when it was worthwhile to fight for your life.\"Udet and another wartime comrade\u2014Suchocky\u2014became pilots to an African filming expedition. The cameraman was another veteran, Schneeberger, whom Udet called \"Flea,\" and the guide was Siedentopf, a former East African estate owner. Udet described one incident in Africa in which lions jumped up to claw at the low-flying aircraft, one of them removing a strip of Suchocky's wing surface. Udet engaged in hunting while in Africa. World War II Building the Luftwaffe Though not interested in politics, Udet joined the Nazi party in 1933 when Hermann G\u00f6ring promised to buy him two new U.S.-built Curtiss Hawk II biplanes (export designation of the F11C-2 Goshawk Helldiver). The planes were used for evaluation purposes and thus indirectly influenced the German idea of dive bombing aeroplanes, such as the Junkers Ju 87 (Stuka) dive bombers. They were also used for aerobatic shows held during the 1936 Summer Olympics. Udet piloted one of them, which survived the war and is now on display in the Polish Aviation Museum. After the trials of the Ju 87, a confidential directive issued on 9 June 1936 by Wolfram von Richthofen called for the cessation of all further Ju 87 development, although the Ju 87 had been awarded top marks and was about to be accepted. However, Udet immediately rejected von Richthofen's instructions and Ju 87 development continued. Udet became a major proponent of the dive bomber, taking credit for having introduced it to the Luftwaffe. On 9 June 1936 he had, through his political connections, been named Chief of the Technical Office, T-Amt, (the development wing of the Reich Ministry of Aviation). Udet had no real interest in this job nor a particular aptitude for it, especially the bureaucracy of it, and the pressure led to him developing an addiction to alcohol, drinking large amounts of brandy and cognac.In January 1939, Udet visited Italian North Africa (Africa Settentrionale Italiana, or ASI), accompanying Maresciallo dell'Aria (Marshal of the Air Force) Italo Balbo on a flight, because at the time there were distinct signs of German military and diplomatic co-operation with the Italians. On 1 February 1939 Udet became Luftwaffe Generalluftzeugmeister (Chief of Procurement and Supply), responsible for all aircraft production, armament and supply. This was a massive organization supervising over 26 departments and, again, requiring organizational qualities for which Udet was not best equipped.When World War II began, his internal conflicts grew more intense as aircraft production requirements were much more than the German industry could supply, given limited access to raw materials such as aluminium. G\u00f6ring responded to this problem by simply lying about it to Adolf Hitler, and after the Luftwaffe's defeat in the Battle of Britain, G\u00f6ring tried to deflect Hitler's ire by blaming Udet. On 22 June 1941, the launch of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, drove Udet further into despair. In April and May 1941, Udet had led a German delegation inspecting the Soviet aviation industry in accordance with the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact. Udet informed G\u00f6ring that the Soviet air force and aviation industry were very strong and technically advanced. G\u00f6ring decided not to report this to Hitler, hoping that a surprise attack would quickly destroy the Soviet Union. Udet realized that the upcoming war on the Soviet Union might destroy Germany. He tried to explain this to Hitler but, torn between truth and loyalty, suffered a psychological breakdown. G\u00f6ring kept Udet under control by giving him drugs at drinking parties and hunting trips. Udet's drinking and psychological condition became a problem, and G\u00f6ring used Udet's dependency to manipulate him. Death By August 1941, the pressures from the Soviet campaign were exacerbating the conflicts between Udet and State Secretary Erhard Milch. In order to attain a mandated quadrupling of production, Milch was pressing Udet for a major reorganisation of his department. Udet resisted, but by September, G\u00f6ring sided with Milch and several members of Udet's staff were removed, as Milch began to assert increasing control over procurement and supply. Udet was losing his freedom of action and was clearly being eclipsed.On 17 November 1941, Udet shot himself in the head while he was on the phone with his girlfriend, Inge Bleyle. Udet's suicide was concealed from the public, and at his funeral, he was lauded as a hero who had died in flight while he was testing a new weapon. On their way to attend Udet's funeral, the World War II fighter ace Werner M\u00f6lders died in a plane crash in Breslau, and the high Luftwaffe executive General der Flieger Helmuth Wilberg died in another plane crash near Dresden. Udet was buried next to Manfred von Richthofen in the Invalidenfriedhof Cemetery in Berlin. M\u00f6lders was buried next to Udet.According to Udet's biography, The Fall of an Eagle, he wrote a suicide note in red pencil that included: \"Ingelein, why have you left me?\" and \"Iron One, you are responsible for my death\". \"Ingelein\" referred to his girlfriend, Inge Bleyle, and \"Iron One\" to Hermann G\u00f6ring. The book The Luftwaffe War Diaries similarly states that Udet wrote \"Reichsmarschall, why have you deserted me?\" in red on the headboard of his bed. Evidence indicates that Udet's unhappy relationship with G\u00f6ring, Erhard Milch and the Nazi Party in general was the cause of a mental breakdown. Portrayals Carl Zuckmayer's 1946 play Des Teufels General (\"The Devil's General\") was a fictional treatment of Udet's final days. Des Teufels General was a 1955 film version of the Zuckmeyer play, with Curd J\u00fcrgens in the title role. In the East German TV miniseries Ohne Kampf kein Sieg (1966) Udet is portrayed by Alfred M\u00fcller. In the film Von Richthofen and Brown (1971), Udet was portrayed by Robert La Tourneaux The character of \"Ernst Kessler\" in the 1975 film The Great Waldo Pepper is clearly based upon Ernst Udet. Kessler was portrayed by actor Bo Brundin. It also contains dogfighting scenes between a Fokker Dr.I and a Sopwith Camel. Udet is featured in the Knights of the Sky video game as an enemy German pilot. In the movie The Red Baron (2008), Udet is portrayed by Ji\u0159\u00ed La\u0161tovka.

Football career Born in Kirkmanshulme, Manchester, Hardman was discovered by Blackpool as a schoolboy and thrown into the first team during their season in exile from the Football League in 1899\u20131900. He made his League debut on 8 September 1900, in a home draw against Gainsborough Trinity, the first competitive game played at Blackpool's Bloomfield Road ground. He became almost an ever-present for the club over the next three years. An outside-left, Hardman had the ability to switch flanks and sometimes played on the right wing. He possessed speed and a knack for trickery, and although not a regular goalscorer himself, he provided the final pass for many of the goals scored by Bob Birkett and Jack Parkinson. Blackpool, however, as a whole, were a team struggling in the Second Division, and they found it too difficult to hold on to him. In 1903, he signed for Everton for a fee of \u00a3100. He played for the Toffees in the 1906 and 1907 FA Cup Finals before joining Manchester United in 1908. Hardman later played for Bradford City, during their first two seasons in Division One, and Stoke City.

Gibson, and was at the helm at the time of the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958, which claimed the lives of 23 people, including eight players, three non-playing staff, and ended the careers of two other players due to injury. He oversaw United's three league title glories of the 1950s as well as their early foray into the European Cup from 1956 to 1958.

Early life Ferguson was born in Syracuse, New York, on January 28, 1929, the only child of Forrest and Mabel Walker Ferguson. He grew up mostly in Bethesda, Maryland, where he graduated from Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. Education Ferguson earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1950 and an MBA in 1951, both from Cornell University, where he also played competitive football, baseball, and track. He was about to be signed as a pitcher by the Washington Senators when an arm injury ended his professional baseball career before it began. He served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War, assigned to a psychological warfare unit that wrote propaganda leaflets for dropping behind enemy lines. According to his wife, Ferguson enjoyed his military service \u2014 he \"thought it was a hoot.\"Ferguson studied law and international relations at Georgetown University and the University of Chicago and earned his juris doctor from the University of Pittsburgh in 1957. He never practiced law, instead remaining firmly in the sphere of international relations and public administration. He spent a year abroad in 1952\u20131953 at the University of Santo Tomas in the Philippines, researching East Asian systems of government. Career Between 1957 and 1960, Ferguson taught as an assistant professor of international affairs at Pitt, worked as an administrative assistant to the chancellor, served as assistant dean in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, and consulted for McKinsey and Company.Ferguson spent the 1960s as a civil servant in the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and Department of State. In 1961, Ferguson became the first Peace Corps director in Thailand. From 1962 to 1964 he served as associate Peace Corps director in Washington and special assistant to Sargent Shriver. Ferguson was the first director of Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) from 1964 to 1966. He served as United States Ambassador to Kenya from 1966 to 1969. He served a stormy eleven months as chancellor of Long Island University, from which position he resigned in 1970 after the university's trustees rejected his proposal to split LIU into four autonomous institutions. He then served as president of Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, from 1970 to 1973. Effective September 1, 1973, he became the ninth president of the University of Connecticut. University of Connecticut Ferguson had a difficult tenure as UConn president. He assumed the presidency just when the state government under Republican governor Thomas Meskill was demanding the university slash costs. The state's annual appropriation declined from $34.5 million in 1971\u201372 to $30.3 million in 1975\u201376, a cut of over 12 percent. Tuition increased from 1975 to 1978, rising from $2,800 per year for in-state students in 1975 to $3,400 in 1978.Faculty and staff unionized in the early 1970s amid declining compensation rates compared to other research universities. The University of Connecticut Professional Employees Association (UCPEA) for most staff and the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) for faculty were established at the university for the first time. Ferguson opposed ultimately unsuccessful efforts by Governor Ella Grasso to consolidate all of Connecticut's public institutions of higher education under a single board of regents, which would have limited UConn's autonomy.Ferguson grew the university's physical plant during his five years. As library materials and student enrollment had far outgrown capacity in the old Wilbur Cross Library, Ferguson lobbied strongly for a new library. In July 1975, UConn broke ground on a new 385,000-square-foot building that would become the Homer Babbidge Library, completed in 1978. Also under Ferguson, the UConn bookstore moved to a cooperative model in 1973 after the failed ownership of Follett. Ground was broken for a new School of Fine Arts building. The Psychology, Institute of Materials Science, and Physics buildings were completed. At the University of Connecticut Health Center, the John N. Dempsey Hospital opened its doors.Like President Homer D. Babbidge Jr. before him, Ferguson faced intensive student activism over social justice issues. When students protesting racism, in violation of Connecticut law, peacefully occupied the Wilbur Cross Library, Ferguson sent in state police to evict the protestors, four of whom reported injuries and one of whom spent days in the infirmary. The Connecticut Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP condemned Ferguson's heavy-handed response and demanded that charges against the protestors be dropped. Ferguson never attained Babbidge's popularity with students or faculty.During Ferguson's tenure, the university also faced a class-action lawsuit by female professors alleging gender discrimination.Ferguson resigned in April 1978 to pursue other opportunities. Later career Following his departure as UConn president in 1978, Ferguson served a five-year term as chief executive of Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty. In 1983, Ferguson, who had not applied for the job but came recommended by the directors, was named president of Lincoln Center. Disliking New York City and the primarily administrative duties of the position, he resigned after only nine months. He later served as president of the American University of Paris from 1992 to 1995.Starting in the 1990s, Ferguson authored several books, including Unconventional Wisdom: A Primer of Provocative Aphorisms (1999), Americana Against the Grain (1999), Tilting at Religion (2003), Sports in America (2004) and Traveling the Exotic (2005).Ferguson served as founder and president of Equity for Africa, an early provider of microloans to rural entrepreneurs. He also was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Pacific Council on International Policy, and other organizations. Personal life Ferguson married Patricia Lou Head of Falls Church, Virginia, in 1950. The couple had two sons, Bruce and Scott, and a daughter, Sherry. Sherry Ferguson married Robert Zoellick, who served as the 11th President of the World Bank Group.Ferguson died on December 20, 2007 from prostate cancer at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he had lived since 1998.

In 2003, Lords published her autobiography, Traci Lords: Underneath It All, which received positive reviews from critics and debuted at number 31 on The New York Times Best Seller list. She is currently starring in the comedy series Swedish Dicks on Pop.  Life and career 1968\u20131983: Early life Lords was born Nora Louise Kuzma on May 7, 1968, in Steubenville, Ohio, to Louis and Patricia Kuzma. Her father's parents were of Ukrainian descent, while her mother was of Irish ancestry. Louis was employed as a steelworker. Kuzma has one elder sister, Lorraine, and two younger sisters, Rachel and Grace. Her parents divorced when she was seven years old and Kuzma moved with her mother and three sisters to her great-grandmother's house. Following the divorce, her alcoholic, abusive father got partial custody. Around that same time, her mother enrolled at Ohio University and became employed part-time. When Kuzma was 12, she moved with her mother, her mother's new boyfriend, and sisters to Redondo Beach, California. She did not see her father for many years after. In September 1982, she began attending Redondo Union High School but dropped out at age 15 to enter the porn industry. During her early school years, Kuzma developed a rebellious attitude. She was angry at her mother and found a father figure in her mother's boyfriend Roger Hayes, as she calls him in her autobiography; he was a drug abuser and molested Kuzma in her sleep. After her mother broke up with Hayes due to his drug use, she began dating his friend. Kuzma refused to follow them to a new place and was left with her older sister Lorraine. Her mother and two younger sisters eventually found a new apartment. 1984\u20131986: Pornography career At age 15, Kuzma became pregnant by her high school boyfriend. Afraid of her mother's reaction, she went to Hayes for help. He arranged for her to have an abortion without her mother's knowledge. Looking for a job to get some money, she was introduced to Hayes' friend and started working for her as a babysitter. The woman offered to improve Kuzma's job opportunities by helping her get a fake driver's license. She provided Kuzma with a new birth certificate on condition that if she were ever caught she would say that she had stolen the phony identification. Kuzma now had the alias Kristie Elizabeth Nussman and a new driver's license that stated she was 20 rather than 15 years old. In February 1984, she answered a newspaper advertisement for Jim South's World Modeling Talent Agency. Posing as her stepfather, Hayes drove her to the agency. After signing a contract, she began working as a nude model and appeared in magazines such as Velvet, Juggs, and Club. During August, when she was selected to model for Penthouse magazine's September 1984 15th-anniversary issue, Kuzma was asked to choose a stage name. According to a 1988 interview, she chose Traci\u2014one of the popular names she had longed for growing up\u2014and Lords, after the actor Jack Lord, since she was a fan of the television series Hawaii Five-O, in which he played Steve McGarrett.Lords made the first of many porn movies in 1984, when she appeared in What Gets Me Hot! alongside Tom Byron, who later became her boyfriend off\u2011screen. She first appeared only in a non-sexual role but was later replaced with a hardcore scene. In her next movie, Those Young Girls, she appeared in a sex role alongside Harry Reems and Ginger Lynn. After turning 16 and appearing with John Leslie (an actor 23 years her senior) in the porno parody Talk Dirty to Me Part III (which won the AVN Award for the best movie), Lords was hailed as the \"Princess of Porn\". She became one of the highest-paid porn actresses of that time, earning more than $1,000 a day. Besides her work in porn, she also appeared in the music video for \"Gimme Gimme Good Lovin'\" by the heavy metal band Helix. Lords continued making more movies until late 1984 when she tried to quit the industry at age 16, but returned a few months later. Just before her 17th birthday, she met Stuart Dell, who became her boyfriend, manager, and business partner - Dell used the pseudonym Steven (or Stephen) Cartier. Together they formed the Traci Lords Company. Dell and Lords made a distribution deal with Sy Adler, an industry veteran who ran Vantage International, in which they would produce three movies for the company. In March 1986, the first TLC feature was released; titled Traci Takes Tokyo, it was shot in Tokyo around Christmas Day 1985. The second, Beverly Hills Copulator, was released afterwards, but the third movie, Screamer, was shelved.During late May 1986 (around three weeks after Lords' 18th birthday), authorities were informed that she had been underage when she appeared in the porn movies. She had lied (according to Lords, it was a \"white lie\") to law enforcement, photographers, producers, directors, co-workers, and the general public for two years. The owners of her movie agency and X-Citement Video, Inc. were arrested (see United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.). She was taken into protective custody and hired high-profile lawyer Leslie Abramson. On July 10, district attorney's investigators searched Lords' Redondo Beach home as well as the Sun Valley offices of Vantage International Productions (a major producer of adult movies) and the Sherman Oaks offices of modeling agent Jim South. South and other industry officials said that Lords, who was seeking employment, provided a California driver's license, a U.S. passport, and a birth certificate, which stated that her name was Kristie Nussman and gave a birth date of November 17, 1962. Leslie Jay, a spokeswoman for Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, also said Lords showed identification indicating that she was older than 18 before the illicit photos for the September 1984 issue were taken. When investigators used Lords' fake birth certificate and fake state identification cards to locate the real Kristie Nussman, Nussman said that her birth certificate had been stolen a few years earlier and that an impostor had apparently forged her name on official forms. Two adults who knew Lords, but who requested anonymity, said they saw her picture in the adult magazine Velvet during July 1984 and telephoned the district attorney's office to inform authorities that she was underage, but that an investigator told them, \"There isn't anything we can do about it.\"On July 17, 1986, video rental shops and adult movie theaters in the US scrambled to remove from their inventory all hardcore material featuring Lords in order to avoid prosecution for distributing child pornography. John Weston, attorney of the Adult Film Association of America, said distributors should withdraw any movie made before May 1986, featuring Lords \"in sexual conduct, no matter how briefly.\" The withdrawal of Lords' movies from the market cost the industry millions of dollars. Government prosecutors declared that Lords was a victim of a manipulative industry, maintaining that she was drugged and made to do non-consensual acts. Industry insiders, including Ron Jeremy, Tom Byron, Peter North, and Ginger Lynn said they never saw her use drugs and that she was always fully aware of her actions. While most of Lords' movies were permanently removed from distribution in the United States, several were re-edited to remove her scenes (such as Kinky Business and New Wave Hookers), or in a few cases, had new footage filmed with a different actress playing her part (as in Talk Dirty to Me Part III). Her only porn movie legally available in the United States is Traci, I Love You, filmed in Cannes, France two days after her 18th birthday. 1987\u20131991: Transition to mainstream, Not of This Earth and Cry-Baby After spending several months in therapy, Lords decided to concentrate on acting. She enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, where she studied method acting for three months. After leaving the school, Lords placed an advertisement in The Hollywood Reporter looking for representation. She was contacted by Fred Westheimer and although the agency declined to officially represent her, he decided to send her out on a few auditions. As a result, she was offered a guest role in an episode of the television series Wiseguy. Shortly afterwards, she met the director Jim Wynorski, who was directing the remake of Roger Corman's 1957 sci-fi classic Not of This Earth. He immediately cast Lords into the lead role of Nadine Story, and Not of This Earth (1988) became her first mainstream film debut since her departure from the adult film industry. Although the film failed at the box office, it did well in video sales. Based on that success, Lords was offered to appear in Wynorski's next film, The Haunting of Morella (1989). However, Lords turned down the offer due to the requirement of having a nude scene, since she was trying to establish herself as a serious actress. She also signed with a modeling agency under her birth name Nora Kuzma and appeared on two covers of Joe Weider's magazine Muscle & Fitness. Around that time, Lords became a spokesperson for Children of the Night, an organization for runaways and abused children, and was planning to release a book titled Out of the Blue: The Traci Lords Story.In November 1988, Lords enrolled in another acting class and again began looking for an agent. In December, she mass-mailed her resum\u00e9 to various agents and arranged a meeting with Don Gerler. Lords auditioned for the part of Breathless Mahoney in the film Dick Tracy (1990), but the role went to Madonna. In March 1989, John Waters auditioned her for his teenage comedy musical Cry-Baby (1990); Waters had referred to Lords as a \"sexual terrorist\". She won the role and appeared in the film alongside Johnny Depp and Ricki Lake. The film was a critical and commercial success, and her portrayal of the rebellious teenager Wanda Woodward established her as a legitimate actress. On the set of the film, she met the property master Brook Yeaton, whom she began dating. The couple married in September 1990 in Baltimore, Maryland. In June 1990, the exercise video Warm up with Traci Lords was released. Directed and produced by her former boyfriend and business partner Stewart Dell, the video had been filmed in early 1988. As Lords wrote in her autobiography, she was unsatisfied with the final version of the video. An extended version was reissued in 1993 under the title Traci Lords: Advanced Jazzthetics. In 1991, Lords starred in the thriller Raw Nerve and the action crime film A Time to Die. Lords appeared in such popular TV shows as Roseanne, Married... with Children, MacGyver and Hercules. She continued modeling and walked the runway for fashion designers such as Janet Howard and Thierry Mugler. 1992\u20131996: Breakthrough, 1000 Fires and Melrose Place During 1992, Lords decided to emphasize her career as a recording artist. She first signed a development deal with Capitol Records. After meeting with Rodney Bingenheimer at a birthday party, she was recommended to Jeff Jacklin, who hired her to record the song \"Love Never Dies\" for the movie Pet Sematary Two (1992). The producer of the soundtrack, Gary Kurfirst, signed Lords to his company Radioactive Records. She was later featured on the songs \"Little Baby Nothing\" by Manic Street Preachers and \"Somebody to Love\" by Ramones. During 1993, Lords was cast in the television adaptation of Stephen King's novel The Tommyknockers.During the spring of 1994, Lords began working on her debut album. The company arranged her to fly to London and meet with producer Tom Bailey. After finishing her recording with Bailey, Lords was introduced to producer Ben Watkins of Juno Reactor with whom she recorded more techno-influenced songs. She later met Mike Edwards, the main singer of the band Jesus Jones. Around the same time, Lords was cast in the television series Roseanne, appearing in three episodes. During January 1995, Lords appeared in four episodes of the television series Melrose Place, where she played the part of Rikki Abbott. Her debut studio album, 1000 Fires, was released on February 28, 1995. It received generally positive reviews and the lead single \"Control\" peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs. An instrumental version of \"Control\" was remixed and released on the soundtrack to Mortal Kombat (1995), which was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album's second single, \"Fallen Angel\", was also successful in charts, peaking at number eleven on Hot Dance Club Songs. The Paul Oakenfold remix of the song was included on the soundtrack of the movie Virtuosity (1995), in which Lords had a cameo appearance. After the release of the album, Lords embarked on a small tour performing as a DJ, mostly in Miami nightclubs. On August 12, 1995, she was the opening act of the Lollapalooza after-party, Enit Festival, alongside Moby, Sven V\u00e4th, DJ Keoki and Single Cell Orchestra.By the end of 1995, Lords divorced her husband of five years, Brook Yeaton. In 1996, she appeared in a commercial for GUESS with Juliette Lewis. 1997\u20132002: Profiler, Blade and First Wave In 1997, Lords appeared in a small part in the Gregg Araki film Nowhere, and starred in the drama thriller Stir. She also guest starred on television series Nash Bridges and Viper. In November, she became a recurring cast member in the second season of the crime television series Profiler. She played a felon, Sharon Lesher, who is manipulated by a serial killer Jack-of-All-Trades and eventually becomes his partner in crime Jill-of-All-Trades. In 1998, Lords had a supporting role in the crime thriller Boogie Boy and starred in the drama Extramarital. She also appeared in the action horror film Blade (1998) in which she played the vampire seductress Racquel. Lords was eventually approached to appear in the sequel Blade II (2002) portraying Racquel's twin sister Valerine in seeking of vengeance upon Blade. However, she turned down the offer because of her contradictory schedule. At the premiere of the film, Lords announced she was finishing her sophomore album on Radioactive Records that would be released in the spring of 1999. However, it was later neglected after she left the record label. In August, Lords ended her two-year relationship with John Enos after they reportedly got into an argument because her cat was killed by one of Enos' dogs. In 2000, Lords had lead roles in the films Epicenter and Chump Change. Her role of Sam in the romantic comedy Chump Change earned her the Film Discovery Jury Award for Best Actress at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. In September, she became a regular cast member in the third season of the Sci-fi Channel television series First Wave, becoming the first recurring female character to be featured on the series. She played Jordan Radcliffe, an heiress and leader of the Human Resistance Group \"The Raven Nation\" after the aliens used her brother to murder her parents. 2003\u20132006: Underneath It All Her autobiography, Traci Lords: Underneath It All, was published during July 2003 by HarperCollins. In the book, Lords chronicled her childhood, career, and two-year stint in the x-rated industry. The book received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, making The New York Times Best Seller list. It was criticized by pornographers, who claim they were the victims. In the book, Lords revealed that she received about $35,000 as total compensation for all her porno movies, including the $5,000 for her underage appearance in Penthouse. Lords continued to use the now-famous stage name that she had given herself as a minor and ultimately made it her legal name. She explained, \"I chose to stop running from it. Instead, I own it, legally changing my name to Traci Elizabeth Lords. That's who I was, and that's who I was going to be.\" In her interview with Oprah Winfrey she stated: \"I found you can run, but you cannot hide.\" During 2003, it was announced that Lords was working on new music and had recorded a cover version of Missing Persons' song \"Walking In L.A.\". Directed by Mike Ruiz, the music video was premiered during her interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show. On December 28, 2004, she independently released two songs, \"Sunshine\" and \"You Burn Inside of Me\", via online music store CD Baby. Both of the songs along with \"What Cha Gonna Do\" was featured in the television series Joan of Arcadia. \"You Burn Inside of Me\" was also used in the commercial for Duprey Cosmetics, in which Lords appeared. She signed to Sea To Sun records the following year, and released the chart-topping single \"Last Drag\". Lords is currently recording new music in Los Angeles. 2007\u20132009: Motherhood and Zack and Miri Make a Porno By the beginning of 2007, Lords became unexpectedly pregnant. She first announced her pregnancy in June: \"I kind of thought the children thing was off the table. Now I'm expecting a boy! We're stunned and thrilled. I just want you to know, these 36-Ds are mine. I haven't had a boob job, she laughed! I am 51\u20442 months pregnant! But now I'm starting to show. And my husband is happy with the changes in my figure.\" On October 7, 2007, at the age of 39, she gave birth to a son, Gunnar Lords Lee, her first child with her husband of five years, Jeff Lee.In January 2008, it was announced that Lords had been cast in Kevin Smith's comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008). She said that at first she wanted to refuse but changed her mind after reading the script. \"It was really great that in taking the movie because I didn't plan on going back to work right away, but I was dying to work with Kevin. I never thought it would be on something called Zack and Miri Make a Porno. What? So I went and I read the script at his house and I was prepared to say no. I thought I have the perfect out. I just had a kid. No one is going to blame me if I say I just can't do this right now. But it made me laugh out loud and it made me just literally cry. It was just funny.\" Initially, the character had a topless scene in the movie, but Lords refused. \"I'm done with all that,\" she said. Lords chose to breastfeed her son in between takes instead. Katie Morgan, a pornographic actress, also appeared in the film.In 2009, Lords appeared in the direct-to-DVD science fiction movie, Princess of Mars, alongside Antonio Sab\u00e0to Jr. She was disappointed by the final project. \"Somewhere in my heart of hearts, I was worried that it might be a crummy movie. The production was just too careless. But I believed the voices of those around me who said 'No, it'll be artistic, no, it'll be creative. You'll look beautiful. We have a very limited budget but honest, you'll be proud.' They were wrong, it was very bad. At least that was what I was told. After watching the first two minutes I had to turn it off and hide under the covers.\" 2010\u20132014: Return to music and Excision In March 2010, Lords announced she began working on her new album with \"Pretty\" being the lead single. However, the project was later shelved and \"Pretty\" was released as a promotional single only.

During his career, he made over 100 appearances in the Football League and won 2 caps for Wales in 1925.  Early life One of seven children, George Harold Beadles was born on Commercial Street in Llanllwchaiarn, on the outskirts of Newtown, Powys, to Thomas, a quarryman who worked on building dams in the Elan Valley Reservoirs, among others, and Sarah Ann Beadles (n\u00e9e Pearce). As a child, he attended a local board school as his parents were keen on him receiving an education due to the economic climate in the area, but he was forced to leave at the age of twelve in order to help support his family and he instead took up employment at a local warehouse, owned by Pryce Pryce-Jones, as a furrier. His brother Albert had also previously worked at the warehouse but had been killed at the age of twelve after being hit by one of the carts used by the warehouse which was taking part in a parade. Pryce-Jones reportedly paid for the funeral. World War I Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Beadles, along with two of his older brothers, Ewart and Ernie, enlisted in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, even though he was only 16 years old at the time, under the permitted age of enlistment. While his regiment was stationed in Britain on training exercises, Beadles was a bugle boy. In 1915, his unit took part in the landing at Suvla Bay in Gallipoli where, despite still being under the minimum age, he served on the frontline as a rifleman. During this time, Beadles performed an action that would later see him awarded the Serbian Gold medal for gallantry. He received the honor for saving the life of a Serbian observer officer who had been wounded in no man's land and was unable to make it back to the line. Under heavy rifle and artillery fire, Beadles helped the officer back, having his cap and epaulettes shot off in the process but remaining unharmed.He remained on the frontline until December 1915, when the area was evacuated due to the heavy fighting. Due to the extreme cold, Beadles was suffering from frostbite and was found floating unconscious in the water at the time of the evacuation and was subsequently sent to a military hospital in Malta. After recovering he was sent to re-join his regiment, who were now stationed in Palestine. He took part in all three attempts to capture Gaza and the eventual push to take Jerusalem under the command of Edmund Allenby. During the second battle of Gaza, Beadles witnessed the death of his uncle Richard Pearce who was shot in the head while standing next to him. Beadles' brother Ewart was awarded the Military Medal and promoted to the rank of Sergeant for his actions during the battle.After the conclusion of the war, his unit remained in Palestine until mid-1919. It was here that he met former Wales international George Latham who was a captain in the regiment and the pair would go on to be lifelong friends. During their time in Palestine, Latham and Beadles played football for their unit, the 7th battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, and won the British Forces in Egypt Football League Cup Final in 1919. Football career Liverpool On his return to Wales, Beadles played for his local side Newtown during the 1919\u201320 season, winning the Montgomeryshire & District Football League. The following year, he moved to Merseyside, where he turned out for amateur team Graysons of Garston of the West Cheshire Association Football League, an amateur side that represented a local shipping company, whilst also working for the company. Beadles often commented on his role at the company to family members, believing he was only employed due to his footballing skills as he would spend most working days making tea. In June 1921, he signed for Liverpool, one of the leading teams in the country at the time, along with teammate Danny Shone.He made his debut on 24 September 1921 in a 1\u20130 victory over Chelsea and scored six goals in his first eleven appearances, including a brace against West Bromwich Albion on 6 May 1922, for the side as they went on to win the Football League First Division title with Beadles being praised for a bright future at the club. However, he was never a regular in the side, making just eighteen appearances in all competitions during his three years at the club, and struggled to displace the more established players, although, following being part of back-to-back league titles, Beadles, along with each member of the squad, was given a gold watch by the club. During his time at Anfield, he played in the 1922 FA Charity Shield defeat against Huddersfield Town, however he became frustrated with his lack of playing time and the club not allowing him to play for Wales in order to cover for players who were being called up by England. Cardiff City He moved to Cardiff City in August 1924, where his friend George Latham was working on the training staff. Signed as cover Joe Clennell, Beadles was forced to wait until 27 September 1924 to make his debut for the club, covering for the injured Clennell in a 1\u20131 draw with Tottenham Hotspur. He was forced to wait another month to make his second appearance for the club, playing in place of Jimmy Gill during a 2\u20131 victory over Everton on 18 October 1924. With Gill injured, Beadles was handed a run of games in the first-team and responded by scoring five goals in four matches during November 1924, including a brace during a 4\u20131 victory over Bury. His prolific form saw Clennell unable to regain his place in the side as Beadles scored four more goals for the club in December, including scoring in consecutive matches against West Ham United on Christmas Day and Boxing Day 1924. However, he was unable to maintain his form and a goal drought, failing to score in ten matches in January and early February 1925, led to manager Fred Stewart dropping Beadles from the side. He appeared sporadically for the side during the remainder of the 1924\u201325 season, eventually breaking his goal drought during a second 2\u20131 victory over Everton, as Stewart offered chances to other players, including Clennell, Alfie Hagan and Paddy McIlvenny.He scored just two more goals in the league in the final three months of the season, in a 1\u20131 draw with Arsenal and a 2\u20131 victory over Liverpool, but scored in both the quarter-final of the FA Cup against Leicester City and a 3\u20131 victory over Blackburn Rovers in the semi-final as Cardiff reached their first FA Cup final. He was part of the side selected to play in the 1925 FA Cup Final, losing 1\u20130 to Sheffield United following a goal from Fred Tunstall. Despite his goal drought, during his time at the club Beadles won two caps for Wales, playing in consecutive matches on 14 and 28 February 1925 against Scotland and England in the 1924\u201325 British Home Championship. The following year, Beadles scored in the opening game of the 1925\u201326 season during a 3\u20132 defeat to Manchester City and scored three times in five further appearances in the opening months of the season. However, despite this form, Beadles was sold to Sheffield Wednesday in order to raise money due to the recession and the arrival of Joe Cassidy from Bolton Wanderers. Later career Beadles never played in the first-team at Sheffield Wednesday, only ever making appearances for the Yorkshire club's reserve side, and was allowed to join Southport in 1926, being appointed club captain on arrival and scoring on his debut during a 1\u20131 draw with Lincoln City on 28 August 1928. Arriving alongside fellow Welsh international Jack Newnes, Beadles scored 20 league goals during his first season at the club, including hat-tricks during victories over New Brighton and Walsall. He also scored in the side's third round FA Cup victory over First Division side Blackburn Rovers. However, he was forced to miss their fourth round tie against Beadles' former club Liverpool due to injury. He spent three seasons at Southport, finishing as the club's top scorer in all three seasons and setting a new club record by scoring in six consecutive matches, between 21 April 1928 and 15 September 1928.Beadles left the club in April 1929 due to a persistent knee injury, scoring a hat-trick in his final ever game in the Football League, a 6\u20132 victory over Hartlepool United on 27 April 1929. During his time with Southport, Beadles scored 61 goals in 92 league matches. Following his departure from Southport, he was appointed player-coach at Irish side Dundalk, making his debut on 25 August 1929 in a match against Shamrock Rovers. In his one season at the helm of the club, he led them to the semi-final of the FAI Cup, losing 2\u20131 to Brideville, a sixth-placed finish in the League of Ireland and handed first-team opportunities to Joey Donnelly and Tommy Godwin. However, he retired from football at the end of the season after persistent injuries and his family being unable to settle in Ireland. Later life After returning to Merseyside, Beadles spent a short time as a prison officer at Walton jail, whilst also working at a local sports equipment retailer. After leaving the jobs he joined Bents Brewery, who at the time were recruiting former professional footballers to front their business. After training as a manager in one of the company's pubs and hotels, he was handed control of The Shakespeare pub in White Chapel and later the Cattle Market Inn in Stanley. Having become an avid Liverpool supporter, still attending games well into old age, after his time at the club, Beadles became well known for his final bar calls at the pub, declaring \"Time gentlemen please, and Evertonian's\".He impressed the brewery's managers so much that he was put in charge of the company's main hotel, The Hillside in Huyton, Liverpool in 1939 and the pub later became popular with American officers who were stationed at nearby RAF Burtonwood during the Second World War. In the late 1940s, his health declined and he was unable to continue running such a large hotel and, after running a smaller pub, he was forced into early retirement in the 1950s. After a long illness, he died on 29 August 1958 at the age of 60 in the village of Sychdyn. He was buried in Everton Cemetery in Liverpool.

Harold Teen begins He drew samples for a strip titled Seventeen, loosely based on Booth Tarkington's successful novel Seventeen. After publisher Patterson renamed it Harold Teen, it debuted in the New York Daily News during February 1919. Asked in the late 1930s why he had started the strip, Ed answered, \"Twenty years ago, there was no comic strip on adolescence. I thought every well-balanced comic sheet should have one.\"Carl Ed's strip was widely read in the 1920s, and his readers became familiar with such slang as \"shebas\", \"sheiks\" and \"pantywaist\". Some of these were words and phrases created by Ed, such as, \"Fan mah brow.\" With the popularity of the strip, Ed profited from merchandising of games, figurines and other products. He added Josie as a topper strip beneath Harold Teen and also found time to work as an instructor at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. Changing times Interest in the strip began to fade by the 1940s. When Ed, who lived at 711 Michigan Avenue in Evanston, Illinois, died October 10, 1959, his once-popular comic strip died with him. (He retired in the last week of September 1959, and Harold Teen continued until his final strips ran out on November 18, 1959.) His widow, Ellen Ed, died in July 1975. Bibliography Ed, Carl.

Life He was born Carl Bryce Seligman, but he and his three brothers, including the noted ichthyologist Hugh Hamilton DeWitt, added \"DeWitt\" from their mother's side of the family, at the urging of their father, in 1950. In the early-1970s, this change of name so angered Felix Bloch that he blocked DeWitt's appointment to Stanford University and DeWitt and his wife Cecile DeWitt-Morette, a mathematical physicist, accepted faculty positions at the University of Texas at Austin. DeWitt served in World War II as a naval aviator. He died September 23, 2004 from pancreatic cancer at the age of 81. He is buried in France, and was survived by his wife and four daughters. Work He pioneered work in the quantization of general relativity and, in particular, developed canonical quantum gravity, manifestly covariant methods, and heat kernel algorithms. DeWitt formulated the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation for the wave function of the universe with John Archibald Wheeler and advanced the formulation of Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. With his student Larry Smarr, he originated the field of numerical relativity. He received his bachelor's (summa cum laude), master's and doctoral degrees from Harvard University. His Ph.D. (1950) supervisor was Julian S. Schwinger. Afterwards, he held a postdoctoral position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, worked at the Lawrence Livermore Lab, and then held faculty positions at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and, later, the University of Texas at Austin.

The date of his birth is uncertain. He married an aristocratic young woman named Ephrosyne when he was quite young. Though pious, he led the normal way of life for a man of his station. One day, as he was engaged in his usual pastime of hunting within his family's domain, he ordered his attendants to set fire to some brushwood in which game had taken refuge. The prevailing wind caused the flames to spread rapidly to the surrounding fields and forest. A peasant who happened to be found near where the fire began was accused of starting the blaze and was imprisoned, tortured to confess, and condemned to death. As the man was being led to execution, a remorseful Conrad publicly admitted his guilt to the Signoria of the city. As punishment and reparation for the damages he had caused, the city seized all his assets, only sparing his life due to his noble status. Franciscan penitent Thus reduced to poverty, and seeking penance for his act of cowardice, Conrad and his wife saw the hand of God in this event. As a result, in 1315 they agreed to separate and Conrad retired to a hermitage near the town of Calendasco, joining a community of hermits, who were Franciscan tertiaries, while his wife became a nun of the Order of Poor Clares at their monastery in the city.Conrad soon developed a reputation for holiness, and the flow of visitors left him unable to keep the solitude he sought. He then embarked on the life of a pilgrim, going to Rome, and from there to the Holy Land and Malta and, about 1340, to Palermo in Sicily, where he was directed to an isolated site in the Val di Noto. After many years of an itinerant life, he settled there in a grotto now named for him and for the rest of his life spent a most austere and penitential life of solitude, working numerous miracles, and gifted with prophecy. In 1343 Conrad felt called by God to serve the local people more directly and in 1343 went to the city of Netum, where he cared for the sick at the Hospital of St. Martin there for the next two years. He lived in a hermitage attached to the Church of the Crucified Christ occupied by the Blessed William Buccheri, a former equerry to King Frederick III of Sicily, who had also taken up a life of solitude and prayer. Conrad would regularly return to his grotto for silent prayer. His fame was such that in 1348 the Bishop of Syracuse, Giacomo Guidone de Franchis, went to his hermitage to beg his prayers for the relief of a famine afflicting the island. Conrad died while in prayer, kneeling before a crucifix, on 19 February 1351, the day he had predicted. At his request, his body was buried at the Church of St. Nicholas, the principal one of the city. After the city was leveled in an earthquake in the 1690s, it was transferred to the new church of the same name built in the relocated city, now called Noto, which now serves as the cathedral of the region. Veneration Miracles Conrad is especially invoked for the cure of hernia. This comes from miracles attributed to him. The legend relates that he was visited at his hermitage by a former friend and companion in arms, Antonio da Stessa, from Daverio. His friend was suffering from the pain of a hernia he had developed. Seeing the pain his old comrade was suffering, Conrad was moved to pity and prayed for him. Stessa was immediately cured of the hernia. The same outcome was accomplished for a local tailor, who suffered severely from several hernias. The miracle for which Conrad is best known is the \"Miracle of the Bread\". This developed during the aforementioned famine which afflicted Sicily as a result of a severe outbreak of the bubonic plague on the island during 1348\u201349. During that catastrophe, anyone who approached the hermit for help was given a loaf of bread, still warm, which, it was said, he had received from the angels. Canonization Shortly after Conrad's death, his demonstrably holy life and the large number of miracles attributed to him led the leadership of the city to request that the Bishop of Syracuse, to which diocese Noto belonged, begin the process for his canonization. When the waiting period required by Church law expired in 1485, this process was opened by Bishop Dalmazio Gabriele, O.P., who had himself witnessed the Miracle of the Bread. As part of the process, Conrad's body was exhumed for examination, and was found to be incorrupt, and placed in a silver urn for the veneration of the public.Pope Leo X beatified Conrad on 12 July 1515 and permitted the town of Noto to celebrate his feast day. On 30 October 1544, Pope Paul III extended permission to the whole island. On 2 June 1625, he was canonized by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, who was the Duke of Parma and Piacenza in a solemn ceremony at the cathedral of Piacenza, where it was declared an obligatory feast. On 12 September of that same year, permission was granted to the Franciscan Order by Pope Urban VIII for a distinct text for the Divine Office and Mass to be used for his feast; today it is celebrated solely by the Third Order of St. Francis to which he belonged. In Vietnam there is a popular devotion to Conrad. On his feast day, the Parish Church of San Corrado in Noto commemorates him by the distribution of blessed bread.

Prevalence and severity Surveys [verification of survey specifications needed e.g. sampling size] have shown that 27% of farmers reported seeing damage to the vents of their hens and 36.9% of farmers reported vent pecking had occurred in their previous flock. Whilst farmers attributed 1.3% of mortalities as due to vent pecking the most common findings at autopsy were different types of cannibalism (65.51%), with vent cannibalism (38.57%) the most common. The type of housing system markedly affects the prevalence of vent pecking with 22.5% of hens affected in free-range systems, 10.0% in barn systems, 6.2% in conventional cages and 1.6% in furnished cages, with a similar rank for the severity of vent pecking injuries. Causation The causes and development of vent pecking are multifarious. Risk factors that have been identified as increasing vent pecking include dim lights placed in nest boxes to encourage hens to use the boxes, the diet being changed more than three times during the egg laying period, the use of bell drinkers, and the hens beginning to lay earlier than 20 weeks of age. Vent pecking is associated with indicators of stress, e.g. fluctuating asymmetry, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio, and tonic immobility duration. Vent pecking can be related to disease or immune challenge as it sometimes becomes prevalent in cases of Gumboro disease (Infectious Bursal Disease) and is increased by challenges with the protein antigen, human serum albumin (HuSA). Housing design can influence vent pecking. Mortality caused by cannibalism was reduced when hens had sufficient room to perch all facing the feed trough, thus giving their perch-mates little opportunity to peck at the vent region and increased pecking activity and cannibalistic behaviour can occur due to inadequate height of the perches. Larger group sizes lead to increases in vent pecking suggesting that social learning plays a role.

Early life Nashiro took an interest in boxing during elementary school, when his father took him to a boxing match for the first time. He became a fan of WBC Bantamweight champion Joichiro Tatsuyoshi, and entered his school's track team to build up his stamina. He was finally allowed to begin boxing in high school, and continued to Kinki University, but dropped out to begin his professional career. His brother Yuji Nashiro is a professional kickboxer. Early career Nashiro made his debut in Osaka in July 2003, knocking out his opponent only 32 seconds into the first round. He won three more fights, and fought Hidenobu Honda in August 2004. Honda was a world ranker at the time, and had challenged Pongsaklek Wonjongkam and Alexander Mu\u00f1oz in world title matches. Nashiro won by 10 round unanimous decision, becoming a world ranker in only his 5th professional fight, and was hailed by boxing fans as one of the top prospects in Japan. Tragedy On April 3, 2005, Nashiro fought Japanese Super flyweight champion Seiji Tanaka. The two had often sparred and trained together, and Nashiro won by TKO in the 10th round, winning the title. However, Tanaka dropped into a coma after the fight, and died two weeks later from a subdural hematoma. Nashiro went into a sort of shock state after Tanaka's death, and seriously contemplated retirement from the guilt he felt. He kept himself away from boxing for over a month, until he met Tanaka's father at Masamori Tokuyama's WBC title defense. Tanaka's father told Nashiro to not worry about what happened to his son, and to continue his boxing career. Nashiro paid a visit to Tanaka's grave in Tottori, Japan, to pay his respects, after defending the title won from Tanaka. Nashiro's struggle was documented on an episode of the Japanese TV show Kiseki Taiken! Unbelievabou! aired on February 22, 2007. World title Nashiro defended his title in November 2005, winning by 10-round decision, and became the top ranked contender in the WBA Super flyweight division. He returned his Japanese Super flyweight title, and fought Mart\u00edn Castillo in July 2006 for the WBA Super flyweight title. Nashiro won the fight by Martin Castillo having hevnling bleeding in the 10th round, becoming a world champion in only his 8th professional fight. This tied Joichiro Tatsuyoshi's record as the fastest Japanese fighter to become world champion. Nashiro could have beaten the record by challenging the world title in his 7th fight, but defended the Japanese Super flyweight title once to show respect for the deceased Tanaka. Nashiro made his first defense in December 2006, against Eduardo Garcia of Mexico. Nashiro won by 12 round unanimous decision to retain his title. Garcia had previously been invited to Japan as Nashiro's sparring partner when he was training for his fight against Mart\u00edn Castillo. Nashiro fought former WBA super flyweight champion Alexander Mu\u00f1oz on May 3, 2007, at the Ariake Coliseum in Tokyo, Japan, for his second defense. Mu\u00f1oz completely overpowered Nashiro, winning the title by unanimous decision. This was the first loss of Nashiro's career. Title regained On September 15, 2008, Nashiro regained the WBA super flyweight title by the split decision victory over fellow Japanese Kohei Kono. Prior to this bout, the title became vacant because Munoz lost it to WBC champion Cristian Mijares who unified it. He defended that title in an optional defense on April 11, 2009, with TKO victory over fellow-Japanese Konosuke Tomiyama. Although he stopped Tomiyama, Nashiro was downed twice in separate rounds. On September 30, 2009, Nashiro fought Hugo C\u00e1zares to a draw. On May 8, 2010, Nahiro lost the WBA super flyweight title in his rematch against Hugo C\u00e1zares.

Legal and human rights activism She has been a member of the team of lawyers for defense of political prisoners since 2001. In the same year, Razan was one of the founders of the Human Rights Association in Syria (HRAS). In 2005, Razan Zaitouneh established SHRIL (the Syrian Human Rights Information Link), through which she continues to report about human rights violations in Syria. From 2005 through to her 2013 disappearance, Razan Zaitouneh was an active member of the Committee to Support Families of Political Prisoners in Syria. Syrian State television aired announcement that Razan Zaitouneh was a foreign agent on 23 March 2011, after which she went into hiding while continuing her legal and human rights work, in order to avoid being arrested.Zaitouneh founded the Violations Documentation Center in Syria in April 2011 to document human rights violations and abuses in the country by all sides. She also contributed to human rights violations reports circulated by the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, of which she was one of the founders.Her husband, Wael Hamadeh (or Wael Hamada, or Wa'el Hammada) was arrested on 12 May 2011. His brother 'Abd al-Rahman Hammada was also arrested. Wael Hamadeh was questioned in prison about his wife's human rights work, then Wael Hamadeh released on 1 August 2011.On 27 October 2011, she was awarded the 2011 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of thought, jointly with four other Arabs. She was previously awarded the Anna Politkovskaya Award by Reach All Women in War. In 2013 Razan Zaitouneh was granted the International Women of Courage Award. 2013 disappearance Pro-opposition websites reported that on 9 December 2013 Zaitouneh had been kidnapped along with her husband, Wael Hamadeh, and two colleagues, Samira Khalil and Nazem Hammadi, in the opposition-held town of Douma to the north of Damascus. As of December 2015, their whereabouts were still unknown and the identity of the kidnappers uncertain, although it was suspected that the Islamist Salafi rebel group Jaysh al-Islam was responsible.As of August 2018, the Associated Press (AP) was unaware of significant evidence for Zaitouneh's fate. AP stated clues suggesting that Jaysh al-Islam had detained Zaitouneh and held her in Tawbeh Prison. Jaysh al-Islam denied the claim. One clue was a graffito seen by several witnesses on a prison cell wall stating, \"I miss my mother \u2013 Razan Zaitouneh, 2016.\" Another clue was the use of one of the Violations Documentation Center computers, taken together with Zaitouneh in the December 2013 kidnapping, from a Jaysh al-Islam IP address at Tawbeh Prison. Another opposition activist, Mazen Darwish, stated that Zaitouneh was held by Jaysh al-Islam until early 2017. AP judged it likely that Zaitouneh had been killed.On 17 February 2020, one of the Syrian intelligence agencies declared that it had discovered a mass grave in al-Ub around the eastern Ghouta dictrict, containing around 70 bodies. One of them appeared to be that of Razan Zaitouneh.In 2020, French authorities arrested Majdi Mustapha Nameh (Islam Alloush) in relation to Zaitouneh's disappearance.In March 2021, a criminal complaint was filed in France by the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression, holding Jaysh al-Islam responsible for her abduction.In July 2022, a clue reported by Deutsche Welle was that two months after the abduction, a member of Jaysh al-Islam had used Zaitouneh's computer to log on to his social media accounts. The computer had been given to Zaitouneh through a project funded by the United States Department of State, enabling geolocation and identification of the user. The Deutsche Welle investigation suggested that the abduction had been masterminded by two local Jaysh al-Islam leaders, Abu Qusai al-Dirani and Samir Kaakeh. When the leader of Jaysh al-Islam at the time, Zahran Alloush, learnt about the abduction he tried to negotiate an agreement to free her and three other abductees. However, Zahran Alloush was killed in a Russian airstrike. His successor (and cousin) Mohammed Alloush refused to continue the proposals for a deal.

Early years Kneitel was born in New York City where he graduated from P.S. 10 in Manhattan and attended the High School of Commerce, taking commercial art courses. He also took evening classes at the National Academy of Design. His father died when Kneitel was still in high school, and he needed work to provide support for his mother and sister.He was able to attend an annex of Commerce HS and work after school and Saturdays for Bray Studios, coloring drawings for Colonel Heeza Liar cartoons. On graduation, he was able to find employment with a small company, L.F. Cornwell, producers of a series called Ebinizer Ebony, which were being made in a now-defunct color process known as Kelly Color. He began as an office boy and within a year was one of their three animators. From 1925 to 1927, he worked as an inbetweener at Max Fleischer's \"Out of the Inkwell\" Studio, and was there for two years when he was offered a position at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios in California as a junior writer.Kneitel spent six months at MGM writing sub-titles for silent pictures, but was dismissed when sound pictures arrived. Heading back East he worked briefly for an outfit that produced cartoons based on the popular Joe Jinks comic strips (the cartoons never were seen publicly). In 1928 he worked for six months at Loucks and Norling on industrial films and the Mutt and Jeff series. Fleischer Studios In 1928, Kneitel returned to Fleischer Studios as an inbetweener, staying there for fourteen years (1928\u20131942), He was there only about six months when he became an animator, and a year later became a head animator. During his time there he provided animation for many films, including the Betty Boop and Popeye the Sailor series, Talkartoons, Screen Songs (with the famous \"bouncing ball\"), and the studio's first feature-length film, Gulliver's Travels.In early 1939, Kneitel suffered a heart attack, and would be absent from the studio until late 1940. Kneitel returned just when Fleischer obtained the right to animate Superman. Kneitel wrote several Superman episodes with Isadore (Izzy) Sparber, and directed one short, The Mechanical Monsters (1941). In January 1942, the Fleischer brothers were forced to resign from the studio they had created; they had borrowed money from Paramount between 1938 and 1941 to finance their expanded Miami facilities and two feature films. After the failure of their second feature, Mister Bug Goes to Town, the studio called in their loans, effectively foreclosing the studio. The successor studio was re-formed by Kneitel, Sam Buchwald and Isadore Sparber and renamed it Famous Studios. Famous Studios Kneitel, Buchwald and Sparber ran Famous Studios for 11 years (1942\u20131953), after which Paramount Pictures subsidized the studio, and Kneitel was employed as director of production. Kneitel himself had become one of the most prolific directors of the Popeye shorts and also directed many of the Casper the Friendly Ghost shorts. Famous Studios also created a series called Noveltoons that included the three popular series; Casper the Friendly Ghost, Herman and Katnip and Baby Huey. He produced cartoons until the day he died. Popeye the Sailor TV series In the summer of 1957, Paramount ceased production of theatrical Popeye shorts. King Features Syndicate, aware of the high ratings that the Popeye shorts had earned on television, commissioned a new series of Popeye shorts for syndication in 1960. Kneitel, head of the Paramount Cartoon Studios (renamed from Famous Studios in 1956), supervised one of four animation units assigned to this project. Due to the usage of limited animation, the quality of these films is inferior to those produced by the Fleischer and Famous Studios. Personal life Kneitel was married to Ruth Fleischer, becoming Max Fleischer's son-in-law, Dave Fleischer\u2019s nephew-in-law, and director Richard Fleischer's brother-in-law. He was also the nephew of musician Sammy Timberg, who wrote many of the scores for Fleischer's cartoons. Kneitel also had a cousin Abner Kneitel, who was the animator and assistant animator for Fleischers and Famous from 1935 to 1944. His son, Tom Fleischer-Kneitel, an avid amateur radio operator (License K2AES), was the founding editor of Popular Communications magazine, and he died on August 22, 2008 at the age of 75. His daughter, Virginia, headed a design and exhibition office for the Smithsonian Institution. Seymour's youngest son, Kenneth, a major collector of vintage material, established and ran the store 'Fandango', in New York City. Kenneth also designed and published many books, and worked several years for Peter Max. Death Kneitel developed heart problems early in life; he died of a heart attack on July 30, 1964 at the age of 56. Three years later, Paramount shut down their animation studio. Kneitel's last cartoon credit was Space Kid (1966).

Career Ozolua returned to Nigeria in 2001 and started Body Enhancements Ltd, a cosmetic surgery company. Despite the challenges of having a controversial service in a conservative African country, Body Enhancement Ltd became a pioneer in the beauty and health sectors in Nigeria. Ozolua used the platform that her business provided to educate the public about the safety of plastic surgery, breaking prevalent myths of the time.In 2003, she founded Empower 54, formerly known as Body Enhancement Foundation, or Body Enhancement Annual Reconstructive Surgery (BEARS), an international humanitarian organization dedicated to providing humanitarian assistance such as medical missions, hunger eradication, education, female empowerment, and refugee programs to underprivileged Africans. Archbishop Desmond Tutu was a patron of Empower 54. All humanitarian aid rendered through Empower 54 is free to the beneficiaries. Under Ozolua's leadership, Empower 54's \"Rise Above Terror\" initiative has been active in rehabilitating women and children survivors of the Boko Haram terrorist group in Nigeria, through self-employment and education for the children at the IDP camps.

Pollack is probably best known to television viewers for his recurring role playing Will Truman's father on the NBC sitcom Will & Grace (2000\u20132006).  Early life Pollack was born in Lafayette, Indiana, to a family of Russian-Jewish immigrants, the son of Rebecca (n\u00e9e Miller) and David Pollack, a semi-professional boxer and pharmacist. The family relocated to South Bend and his parents divorced when he was young. His mother, who suffered from alcoholism and emotional problems, died at the age of 37, when Pollack was 16.Despite earlier plans to attend college and then medical school, Pollack left Indiana for New York City soon after finishing high school at age 17. Pollack studied acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre from 1952 to 1954, working on a lumber truck between terms.After two years of army service ending in 1958, he returned to the Playhouse at Meisner's invitation to become his assistant. In 1960, John Frankenheimer, a friend of Pollack, asked him to come to Los Angeles to work as a dialogue coach for the child actors on Frankenheimer's first big picture, The Young Savages. It was during this time that Pollack met Burt Lancaster, who encouraged the young actor to try directing. Career Pollack played a director in The Twilight Zone episode \"The Trouble with Templeton\" in 1961. But he found his real success in television in the 1960s by directing episodes of series, such as The Fugitive and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. After doing TV he made the jump into film with a string of movies that drew public attention. His film-directing debut was The Slender Thread (1965). Over time, Pollack's films received a total of 48 Academy Award nominations, winning 11 Oscars. His first Oscar nomination was for his 1969 film They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, and his second in 1982 for Tootsie. For his 1985 film Out of Africa starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford, Pollack won Academy Awards for directing and producing.During his career, he directed 12 actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Jane Fonda, Gig Young, Susannah York, Barbra Streisand, Paul Newman, Melinda Dillon, Jessica Lange, Dustin Hoffman, Teri Garr, Meryl Streep, Klaus Maria Brandauer and Holly Hunter. Young and Lange won Oscars for their performances in Pollack's films. One of a select group of non- and\/or former actors awarded membership in the Actors Studio, Pollack resumed acting in the 1990s with appearances in such films as Robert Altman's The Player (1992) and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut (1999), often playing corrupt or morally conflicted power figures. As a character actor, Pollack appeared in films such as A Civil Action, and Changing Lanes, as well as his own, including Random Hearts and The Interpreter (the latter also being his final film as a director). He also appeared in Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives as a New York lawyer undergoing a midlife crisis, and in Robert Zemeckis's Death Becomes Her as an emergency room doctor. His last role was as Patrick Dempsey's father in the 2008 romantic comedy Made of Honor, which was playing in theaters at the time of his death. He was a recurring guest star on the NBC sitcom Will & Grace, playing Will Truman's (Eric McCormack) unfaithful but loving father, George. In addition to earlier appearances on NBC's Just Shoot Me and Mad About You, in 2007, Pollack made guest appearances on the HBO TV series The Sopranos and Entourage. Pollack received the first annual Extraordinary Contribution to Filmmaking award from the Austin Film Festival on October 21, 2006. As a producer he helped to guide many films that were successful with both critics and movie audiences, such as The Fabulous Baker Boys, The Talented Mr. Ripley, and Michael Clayton, a film in which he also starred opposite George Clooney and for which he received his sixth Academy Award nomination, in the Best Picture category. He formed a production company called Mirage Enterprises with the English director Anthony Minghella. The last film they produced together, The Reader, earned them both posthumous Oscar nominations for Best Picture. Besides his many feature film laurels, Pollack was nominated for five Primetime Emmys, earning two: one for directing in 1966 and another for producing, which was given four months after his death in 2008. The moving image collection of Sydney Pollack is housed at the Academy Film Archive.

They had three children: Steven (1959\u20131993), Rebecca (b. 1963), and Rachel (b. 1969). In November 1993, Steven died at the age of 34 in the crash of a small, single-engine plane which clipped a power line and burst into flames in Santa Monica, California. Claire, Pollack's wife, died on March 28, 2011 at 74 years of age, from Parkinson's disease.Concerns about Pollack's health surfaced in 2007, when he withdrew from directing HBO's television film Recount, which aired on May 25, 2008. He died from cancer the following day at his home in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, at the age of 73. He had been diagnosed about ten months prior to his death; the type of cancer has been variously cited as pancreatic, stomach, or of unknown primary origin.

Career The son of a train driver, Malcolm was born above a grocery in Upton Park, a short distance from the Boleyn Ground. He joined West Ham United in 1948 from Dury Falls Secondary School in Hornchurch, and worked in the club office as well as playing. With experience of international football as captain of England Schoolboys, he became the first West Ham player to represent England Youth in April 1948 when he played all three games of the International Youth Football Association Tournament, which ended with England beating Netherlands in the Final.Malcolm made his Eastern Counties League debut for the West Ham 'A' team in January 1949. He signed professional forms with the club in July 1950 and received a \u00a310 signing on fee. His debut in the Football Combination came the following month, and he played his first London Midweek League fixture in October.After nearly 100 reserve appearances, Malcolm made his senior debut in October 1953, an Essex Professional Cup encounter against Colchester United at Layer Road that the hosts won 5\u20131. He made his Second Division debut on 5 December against Notts County, another loss. He made 14 League appearances that season, replacing Derek Parker in a team that finished 13th. His three FA Cup appearances included a home tie against Blackpool on 30 January 1954, the day after his father had died. The game ended 1\u20131, and West Ham lost the replay after Malcolm pulled a thigh muscle.Malcolm's first full season, 1954\u201355, saw 38 League appearances. He played 22 League games in 1955\u201356, and was also part of the team that narrowly missed out on an FA Cup semi-final after losing a sixth-round replay against Tottenham Hotspur. In 1956\u201357, he made 37 League appearances.Malcolm was a member of the team that gained Ted Fenton's West Ham promotion as champions of the Second Division in 1957\u201358. He played in every league game of the campaign, the only player to do so, and scored his first three goals for the club. The season also saw the first award of the 'Hammer of the Year' title and Malcolm became the first player to receive the accolade after being nominated by a journalist at The Stratford Express (subsequent recipients would be awarded the title after a vote by supporters).The following season, 1958\u201359, saw a sixth-place finish in the First Division, with Malcolm again an ever-present. He gained a winners medal in the Essex Professional Cup after playing in the final, against Leyton Orient.In October 1958, Malcolm, along with teammate John Bond, represented the Football League against the Scottish League.On 16 January 1960, Malcolm's run of 110 consecutive League appearances came to an end. On 5 November 1960, he scored his fourth and final goal for West Ham in a 6\u20130 drubbing of Arsenal. His final appearance in claret and blue would come on 28 October 1961, a 2\u20133 loss to Sheffield Wednesday at Upton Park.Finding that there was no room for his style of play under Ron Greenwood, Malcolm left Hammers after 283 league appearances, one season away from qualifying for a testimonial match. He joined Chelsea in return for \u00a310,000 and centre-forward Ron Tindall in part exchange.Malcolm made his debut in a struggling Chelsea side on 4 November 1961. He was named captain six games later, taking over duties from Frank Blunstone. He made 27 League appearances for the club, his only goal coming against west London rivals Fulham on 13 January 1962, but was unable to prevent Chelsea's relegation to the Second Division at the end of the 1961\u201362 season. A dispute with manager Tommy Docherty saw Malcolm hand in a transfer request. This was declined, but a move to Third Division club Queens Park Rangers for \u00a310,000 was to come in October 1962. He made 84 League appearances for QPR under Alec Stock, although an eye injury threatened to end his career in 1964\u201365.After leaving QPR in 1965, Malcolm moved to South Africa where he played for two seasons in Port Elizabeth, for Port Elizabeth City and then the Greek side Westview Apollon.Upon his return to England, Malcolm played for Southern League club Brentwood Town for the 1967\u201368 season. Style of play Malcolm is described in the Who's Who of West Ham United thus: Feared by the leading inside-forwards of his day because of his ability to close-mark and block his opponents out of the game, Johnny Haynes, Jimmy Greaves and Denis Law all gave testimony to Malcolm's prowess. A tough-tackling unassuming character, he must rank as one of the finest wing-halves the club ever employed. An obituary in The Independent concurred: The unobtrusive but unremittingly tough Malcolm was indeed a formidable enforcer who tackled ruthlessly and was tenacious when marking an opposing danger man, especially during his prime with West Ham United. Yet he was deceptively skilful, a precise and perceptive passer endowed with more subtle shades of ability than most ball-winning wing-halves of his era. After football After his retirement from football, Malcolm worked at ice cream company Lyons and then became a publican. From 1968, he was landlord of The Ship and Anchor in Maldon, Essex and The Lion in Latchingdon, Essex, and played Sunday league football with some of his customers. In 1986, he emigrated to Port Elizabeth, South Africa.Malcolm died at his home in Port Elizabeth on 26 December 2013. West Ham club anthem \"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\" played at his funeral.

He started playing guitar when he was eleven or twelve, inspired by the Beatles and hoping to get the attention of girls. Although he was drawn to Jimi Hendrix and played in a garage band, he found rock and pop music too conventional. He gravitated to the avant-garde jazz of Anthony Braxton and Derek Bailey. Braxton persuaded Chadbourne to abandon his intention to enter journalism and instead pursue music.During the early 1970s, he lived in Canada to avoid military service in the Vietnam War. Returning to the United States, he moved to New York City in the mid 1970s and played free improvisation with Henry Kaiser and John Zorn. Around this time, he released his first album, Solo Acoustic Guitar. In the early 1980s, he led the avant-rock band Shockabilly with Mark Kramer and David Licht.Chadbourne explored other genres, playing with a Cajun band and a Russian folk band at a festival in Winnipeg. He mixed country, Western, and improvisation in the band LSD C&W. For many years he was in a duo with Jimmy Carl Black, who played drums for Frank Zappa. He has also worked with Han Bennink, Fred Frith, Elliott Sharp, and Charles Tyler.A solo album, Songs (Intakt, 1993), featured politically oriented originals, such as \"Hello Ceausescu\", and covers, such as Nick Drake's \"Thoughts of Mary Jane\", Phil Ochs' \"Knock on the Door\"and Floyd Tillman's \"This Cold War With You\". Chadbourne invented an instrument known as the electric rake by attaching an electric guitar pickup to a rake. He played a duet of electric rake and classical piano with Bob Wiseman on Wiseman's 1991 album Presented by Lake Michigan Soda. He also played the instrument on a Sun Ra tribute album.

He recorded his first major league hit on September 25, a home run off the Washington Nationals' Ross Detwiler. Ruf totaled three home runs and 10 RBIs in his 12-game \"cup of coffee\" at the end of the season. An article on Phillies Nation summarized his season and journey through the minor league system: Darin Ruf slugged his way onto the scene about midway through the 2012 season with the Reading Phillies; it wasn't as though Ruf was some highly-touted prospect everyone knew about. Really, he was an afterthought at 26 years old; a guy who was just kind of there. That all changed. Ruf started the 2013 season in Triple-A with the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, but was recalled by the Phillies on July 6 when Ryan Howard was placed on the disabled list. In the minor leagues he was named a Baseball America Double-A All Star. At the major league level, he finished fifth among rookies with 14 home runs, nine of which were in August, the most among any major league player during that stretch. Of his 70 starts at the major league level, 28 were at first base, 27 in right field, and 16 in left field, while of his 78 starts in Triple-A, 59 came in left field and 19 came at first base. Ruf struggled to find a spot on the Phillies roster at which he could contribute, despite strong performance: \"Even after proving he can be a productive offensive contributor and showing his defensive versatility, Ruf's spot in the Phils\u2019 lineup may not be locked in for next season.\" one columnist wrote. For the season, he batted .247\/.348\/.458. Entering the 2014 season, he was set to compete for a spot on the bench, as Amaro declared that he was not good enough, particularly defensively, to play every day. However, the Phillies placed him on the disabled list (DL) due to a strained oblique; his estimated recovery time was around the end of April or the beginning of May. When Ruf returned, he played for the IronPigs, but suffered another injury on June 3, fracturing his left wrist when sliding into the wall while playing left field. He returned to the major league Phillies on July 22 when John Mayberry, Jr. landed on the disabled list, but struggled in his first several games; in his first 17 at-bats, he had just two hits. Nevertheless, the Phillies toyed with platooning him with Ryan Howard, who was also struggling, at first base, and Ruf also played two innings at third base. Overall, Ruf amassed only 117 major league plate appearances, batting .235\/.310\/.402, and was significantly hindered by injuries.As 2015 began, Ruf once again had to fight for playing time; there was no clear opening for him on the Phillies' roster, notwithstanding the fact that he was one of the few players on the roster with the ability to hit for power. For the season, he batted .235\/.300\/.414. He had the lowest batting average against right-handers among all MLB hitters (140 or more plate appearances), at .158.On May 13, 2016, Ruf was optioned to Triple-A to make room on the roster for Tommy Joseph. With Lehigh Valley he was second in the league with 20 home runs, 5th with a .529 slugging percentage, and 7th with 65 RBIs. He was named an MiLB.com Organization All Star. For the season in the major leagues, he batted .205\/.236\/.337. On November 11, 2016, Ruf was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers (along with Darnell Sweeney) in exchange for Howie Kendrick. Samsung Lions (2017\u20132019) On February 17, 2017, Ruf's $1.1 million contract with the Dodgers was sold to the Samsung Lions of the KBO League. In his first season in South Korea, Ruf batted .315\/.396\/.569 and led the KBO League with 124 RBIs while also hitting 38 doubles (5th) and 31 home runs (6th).He was re-signed for the 2018 season at $1.5 million. In 2018 he batted .330\/.419\/.605 with 33 home runs (8th) and 125 RBIs (tied for 2nd) and 65 walks (6th) with a 1.024 OPS (3rd).In 2019 he batted .292\/.396\/.515 with 35 doubles (4th in the league), 22 home runs (6th), 101 RBIs (5th), and 80 walks (2nd), with a .911 OPS (5th). Ruf became a free agent following the 2019 season. San Francisco Giants (2020\u20132022) On January 23, 2020, Ruf signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants. He made the team's opening day roster. He finished the season batting .276\/.370\/.517 with 5 home runs and 18 RBIs in 87 at bats over 40 games.For the 2021 season, the Giants extended Ruf through one-year arbitration on a $1.275 million deal. In the 2021 regular season, he batted .271\/.385\/.519 with 16 home runs and 43 RBIs in 262 at bats. He played 44 games at first base, 33 games in left field, 5 games in right field, and pitched in one game.On March 22, 2022, Ruf signed a 2-year, $6.25 million contract with the Giants, avoiding salary arbitration. In a July 21 game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Ruf hit a game-tying grand slam off of Dodgers reliever Alex Vesia. However, the Giants would ultimately lose the game 6-9. New York Mets On August 2, 2022, Ruf was traded to the New York Mets in exchange for J. D. Davis, Carson Seymour, Nick Zwack and Thomas Szapucki. Ruf made his Mets debut on August 5, 2022, entering as a pinch hitter for Tyler Naquin and remaining in left field. On August 15, Ruf made his first pitching appearance for the Mets, throwing two scoreless innings in a loss against the Atlanta Braves, in the process becoming the first regular position player to pitch multiple innings in one game for the Mets. Player profile Eric Longenhagen, a baseball analyst for Crashburn Alley, asserted in 2013 that Ruf's ceiling was a platoon player at first base, but that his superior intangibles had allowed him to overachieve in terms of his potential. He wrote, For him to be anything more than that would be positively historic. We\u2019ve never seen a player of this age with a similar skill set (a fringe average hitter with a huge hole in his swing and plus raw power who is a 20 runner with pretty much unknown arm strength) do anything sustainable of note at the major league level. Ruf turns 28 halfway through next year and possesses both a skillset and body that typically don't age well. It's a very weird situation but it's a triumph of the Phillies player development system and of Ruf's effort that he ever put on a Major League uniform at all. Offense Ruf is a strong power hitter who, according to one talent evaluator quoted in Lindy's Sports 2014 baseball preview magazine, possessed \"raw country strength\" at the plate. He has an uppercut swing, and struggles to hit outside pitches because of poor balance at the plate, but consequently, is able to hit fly balls and drive mistake pitches out of the park. He is a patient hitter, and hits left-handed pitchers better than right-handed pitchers. Defense Ruf has played first base as well as both of the corner outfield spots during his career, and focused on the outfield during the latter stages of his development because of Ryan Howard's perceived preeminence at first base. In the outfield, Ruf is a \"liability\", and he is \"pretty shaky\" at first base, further underscoring his \"man without a position\" persona within the Phillies' organization. This has led some to suggest he would be better suited as a designated hitter in the American League. In the 2020 season, which saw the DH introduced to the National League, the Giants used him in this capacity as well as in the field. Personal life Ruf's wife is Libby Schuring, whom Ruf married in December 2011. His hobbies include golfing and traveling. During the offseason, he resides in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. Christa Ruf, Ruf's sister, also attended Creighton; she played softball there for four seasons.

Early life, education and family Born to Annie (n\u00e9e Lawrie) and James Mackintosh, Mackintosh was born in Inverness and raised primarily in Tain, a small town in the Scottish Highlands. His mother was a governess and his father was a naval officer. Educated at Inverness Royal Academy, Mackintosh initially applied to join the Fleet Air Arm as a pilot but was rejected due to poor eyesight. A subsequent application to join the Royal Air Force was also rejected for the same reason. After spending an additional year at school, Mackintosh applied for entry to Britannia Royal Naval College in 1958 to train as a Royal Navy officer and was accepted. In September 1969, he married Sharron Carter, daughter of a Royal Navy officer, and they had two daughters. Mackintosh and Carter subsequently divorced. Career Mackintosh's first novel, A Slaying in September, was published in 1967. He wrote four other original novels between 1967 and 1970; his later books were either based on his television series, or were novelizations of televised episodes of his television series. Whilst serving as a Royal Navy officer, Mackintosh co-created the popular and acclaimed BBC television drama series Warship (1973\u20131977) and wrote several of its episodes. It was set on board the fictional HMS Hero (F42), which was portrayed by the real Leander-class frigate HMS Phoebe. Mackintosh was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1976 Birthday Honours on his retirement from the Royal Navy. Employed at Yorkshire Television as a screenwriter after Warship, Mackintosh created and wrote most of the episodes of Wilde Alliance, Thundercloud, and The Sandbaggers. Disappearance On the evening of 7 July 1979, Mackintosh was flying with two others (his friend and an experienced British Airways captain Graham Barber, who was the pilot; and Mackintosh's girlfriend, Susan Insole) over the Gulf of Alaska in a light aircraft. The plane sent out a distress signal, which was picked up by the United States Coast Guard. The plane's last-known position was searched, but no wreckage of the plane was ever found, and its passengers have not been heard from since. Bibliography Mackintosh, Ian. (1978). The Sandbaggers.

She was a figure in the early 1960s folk music revival.\n\n  Biography Hester's first album was produced by Norman Petty in 1957. She made her second album for Tradition Records, run by the Clancy Brothers, in 1960. She became known for \"The House of the Rising Sun\" and \"She Moved Through the Fair\".Hester was one of many young Greenwich Village singers who rode the crest of the 1960s folk music wave, helping launch Gerde's Folk City in 1960. She appeared on the cover of the May 30, 1964 issue of the Saturday Evening Post. According to Don Heckman of the Los Angeles Times, Hester was \"one of the originals\u2014one of the small but determined gang of ragtag, early-'60s folk singers who cruised the coffee shops and campuses, from Harvard Yard to Bleecker Street, convinced that their music could help change the world.\" Hester, dubbed \"The Texas Songbird,\" was politically active, spearheading the controversial boycott of the television program Hootenanny when Pete Seeger was blacklisted from it.John H. Hammond signed Hester to Columbia Records in 1960. That same year Hester met Richard Fari\u00f1a, and they married 18 days later. They separated after less than two years. In 1961, Hester met Bob Dylan and invited him to play on her third album, her first on the Columbia label. Recorded at Columbia Studios, New York City, in September 1961, this album was Bob Dylan's first official recording. Hammond, her producer, quickly signed Dylan to the label. Hester turned down the opportunity to join a folk trio with Peter Yarrow and Paul Stookey, who then found stardom with Mary Travers as Peter, Paul, & Mary. Hester collaborated with Bill Lee and Bruce Langhorne, but she concentrated exclusively on traditional material. In the late 1960s, unable to succeed as a folk-rock artist, she explored psychedelic music as part of the Carolyn Hester Coalition before drifting out of the music industry of the period.Hester has disputed David Hajdu's depiction of her marriage to Fari\u00f1a in his book Positively 4th Street: The Lives and Times of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Mimi Baez Fari\u00f1a, and Richard Fari\u00f1a. She has claimed that there are exaggerations in his description of the relationships among Dylan, Baez, Hester, and the Fari\u00f1as. She has denied that Fari\u00f1a was as close to Dylan as some rock historians claim and has strongly disputed that Fari\u00f1a was in any way responsible for Dylan's success as Hajdu suggested. Hajdu also suggested that Hester had an ongoing rivalry with Baez and her sister Mimi. To this day, Hester maintains that, on the contrary, she did not and does not know Baez well and that they never were rivals personally or professionally.In 1969, Hester married the jazz pianist-producer-songwriter David Blume, the composer of The Cyrkle's 1966 Top 40 hit \"Turn Down Day.\" Together Hester and Blume formed the Outpost label. They also started an ethnic dance club in Los Angeles. In the 1980s she returned to recording and touring. She and Nanci Griffith performed Bob Dylan's \"Boots of Spanish Leather\" at Dylan's Thirtieth Anniversary Tribute Concert at Madison Square Garden in 1992.In 1999, Hester released a Tom Paxton tribute album. She appeared on the A&E television Biography of Bob Dylan in August 2000. Hester was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the World Folk Music Association in 2003.Blume died in the spring of 2006. Hester closed the dance club Cafe Danssa a year after his death. She continues to perform and tour with her daughters Amy Blume and Karla Blume. They recorded an album We Dream Forever, released in 2010.

Namesakes The stadium facility was named for Alfred A. McKethan, a University of Florida alumnus and successful Florida banker, businessman, and politician who contributed significant funds for the reconstruction and expansion of the stadium. McKethan donated the equivalent of $800,000 for the reconstruction and improvement of the stadium in the 1980s and 1990s. The playing field was named for Carl E. \"Tootie\" Perry, a former Florida Gators football player who was the Gators' first All-Southern selection in 1920 and 1921 and team captain in 1921. Perry's family formerly owned the land on which the baseball stadium was built, and donated the land to the university. History In the earliest years of baseball at the University of Florida, club teams played at a field in downtown Gainesville's Porters Community. In 1911, the team moved on campus to Fleming Field, where the northern endzone of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium stands today. The varsity team was founded in 1912 and continued to play at Fleming Field through 1948. Eventually, an expansion to the football stadium forced the team to move 500 yards southwest to Perry Field.Wanting to improve college baseball facilities in the state of Florida, New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner provided funds for the university to install lights at Perry Field in 1977. Perry Field went on to host three exhibitions (in 1977, 1981, and 1987) where the Gators faced the Yankees. The most memorable of these was the March 23, 1977 contest, where an overflowing crowd of 3,820 saw the Gators mount a valiant effort in a 10-9 defeat.Perry Field was further improved in 1981 with a $10,000 donation by former catcher Tom Shannon. A home team dugout, training room, and storage area were added to the facility. A notorious hill in left field, which rose 30 feet to the wall, proved an imposing obstacle to visiting outfielders. Funded by Alfred McKethan, other athletic boosters, and the state government, a $2.4-million concrete stadium was constructed in 1987 to replace the existing bleachers at Perry Field for the 1988 season. The stadium was dedicated in McKethan's honor on February 23, 1988, before a 3-2 victory by the Gators over Miami. Initially seating 3,300 spectators (2,500 grandstand, 800 chairback), capacity was increased to 4,300 in the summer of 1995 with an expansion to the grandstand. A further $650,000 worth of renovations the following year improved the plaza surrounding the grandstand as well as the press box. New grass was installed in 1997 while 700 more seats were added along the left field line. The final major renovation to McKethan Stadium came in 2006, when $13 million was spent to improve the stadium and the adjacent Lemerand Athletic Center. The project incorporated a new baseball-specific building, the roof of which became the Don and Irene Dizney Plaza, a location where fans could overlook the field from above the foul territory in left field. Additional seating was also built, including 400 bleacher seats in left field, increasing the capacity to 5,500. A high-resolution videoboard was added beyond right field in 2012.The Gators finished 33 seasons at McKethan Stadium after hosting 1,214 games of baseball, with 911 victories to just 303 defeats (.750). The stadium also hosted the 1989 SEC Tournament, 16 NCAA Regionals, and nine NCAA Super Regionals. Won by Florida in bold Facilities The stadium facility was a concrete structure that seated approximately 5,500 fans, including 2,408 chairback seats around the inner diamond. The asymmetrical stadium seated about two-thirds of its spectators left of home plate. Outfield seating was limited to a section of bleachers in left field. Visible past left field was the O'Connell Center and Ben Hill Griffin Stadium behind it, while the view beyond right field was of the Graham Woods Conservation Area. The courtyard-like plaza surrounding the grandstand could host food trucks and merchandise stalls, while permanent concession facilities and restrooms were built under the grandstands themselves. A south entrance provided entry to the right field stands while a north entrance gave access to the left field stands (ticket booths were available at both entrances). Facilities included a training center, video room, staff offices, and locker rooms for both home and visiting teams. The Gators' bullpen and batting cages were enclosed, under the Dizney Plaza.         Attendance and records In 33 seasons of baseball, McKethan Stadium hosted over 3.2 million fans for Florida home games. Support was greatest in the ballpark's final 11 seasons, with an average of over 3,000 spectators per game each year. Ultimately, 61 contests drew a crowd of 5,000 or greater. Attendance at McKethan Stadium peaked in 2018, the year following Florida's first national championship campaign. That season, the Gators ranked ninth among Division I baseball programs in total attendance with 165,551 persons attending 41 games and 14th in average attendance with 4,038 persons per home game. In 21 of its final 23 seasons, McKethan Stadium finished in the top 15 nationally for total attendance. The record for highest attendance in a single game at McKethan Stadium was set on April 9, 2016; a total of 6,244 spectators watched Mississippi State defeat the Gators 10-4 in the second game of a three-game series. This defeat ended the longest home winning streak in school history, a 29-game run that spanned the 2015 and 2016 campaigns. A season later, the highest total attendance record for a three-game series was made on February 26, 2017; 16,807 tickets were sold for the Gators' sweep of Miami. The best-attended two-game series in the ballpark's history was the 2015 Gainesville Super Regional, when 11,481 fans witnessed Florida sweep Florida State. Replacement On October 9, 2017, the University Athletic Association submitted a project plan to the University of Florida outlining a new baseball stadium that was expected to begin construction in September 2018 and be completed by the end of 2019 with a budget of $50 million. Following delays, construction ultimately began February 2019 and concluded in August 2020, with a finished budget of approximately $65 million.The new stadium increased available chairbacks from 2,408 to 4,000 with 700 club seats and an expandable capacity of about 10,000. The design includes a 360-degree concourse, shade canopy, and open air seated grandstand.The new facility is located on the Southwest part of campus, adjacent to Pressly Softball Stadium and Dizney Stadium, utilizing 13.63 acres (5.52 ha) of land previously occupied by the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agriculture Sciences (UF\/IFAS). UF\/IFAS facilities on this property were relocated to a nearby part of campus.

He received master's degrees in philosophy (1992) and political science (1993), as well as a PhD in political science (1998). Returning to Taiwan after graduating from Yale, Lin served on the faculty of the political science department at National Chung Cheng University as an assistant professor from 1999 through 2004. His research interests include the democratization of Taiwan, as well as the political and economic development of the People's Republic of China, and has written several books on the subjects.Lin is married to Liao Wan-ju (\u5ed6\u5a49\u5982). Political career Lin was appointed as an advisor to the National Security Council in 2000, and to the position of cabinet spokesman in 2003. Lin represented the government position in a debate against Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei, where he argued in favor of arms procurements which would be submitted to referendum the following year.Due to his performance as cabinet spokesman, Lin was appointed director of the Government Information Office (GIO) by President Chen Shui-bian following his reelection in 2004. In January 2005, Lin authorized a GIO program encouraging donations to provide financial support for orphans of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Controversy over the program later arose in August 2005, five months after Lin had left GIO, surrounding the delay in disbursing NT$400 million in donations to various charities and NGOs. Media reports suggesting that the program had been neglected in the transition between Lin and his successor at GIO, Pasuya Yao were denied by GIO, which promised the funds would be disbursed by September 5.Lin resigned from his position as GIO director in March 2005 to run as Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate for mayor of Taichung City. In the ensuing elections held in December 2005, Lin lost against incumbent Mayor Jason Hu by 87,075 votes (19.3%). In 2014 Lin ran again against Hu and won by a landslide margin, over 200,000 votes.Lin was appointed DPP Secretary-General in January 2006, and Deputy Secretary-General to the President in October 2007.

Lovell played in all 3 finals games for the club including wins against Norths and eventual premiers Brisbane and the heartbreaking preliminary final loss to arch rivals Canterbury. With Parramatta leading 18\u20132 with less than 10 minutes to play, Canterbury staged a comeback scoring 3 tries in 8 minutes with Canterbury player Daryl Halligan kicking 2 goals from the sideline to tie the game at 18-18. Parramatta player Paul Carige then made a series of personal errors which cost Parramatta dearly in extra time with Canterbury going on to win 32\u201320. The game is often referred to as one of the biggest preliminary final chokes of all time and this would be Lovell's last match for the club. Lovell then moved to England and played with Huddersfield-Sheffield before returning to Australia in 2001 to play with the now defunct Northern Eagles. Lovell finished his career with Cronulla-Sutherland and his last game in first grade was the 2002 preliminary final loss against the New Zealand Warriors.

He is a co-founder of the creative association Masoch Fund.Ihor Podolchak was named as one of the 10 most prominent Ukrainian filmmakers by Forbes Ukraine in 2014, member of Ukrainian Film Academy.  Biography Podolchak was born in Lviv, Ukrainian SSR, USSR (now Ukraine). He graduated from Lviv Academy of Fine Arts (then Lviv State Institute of Applied and Decorative Arts) with distinction in 1984. From 1984 to 1985 he served in the Soviet Border Troops on the Soviet-Polish border. From 1985 to 1986 he worked in the Art Fund of the Union of Artists of Ukraine. Since 1986 - a free artist and curator of contemporary art. Participant and laureate of numerous international exhibitions, organized and held a number of international exhibitions in Ukraine, Russia, USA, Norway. After establishing the Masoch Fund, together with Igor Durich, he actively conducted various artistic projects in Ukraine, in Russia, in Germany. Since 1997, he has been engaged in the integrated design of the visual-image component of political election campaigns in Ukraine and Russia. Since 2006, he writes scripts, shoots and produces movies: Las Meninas - 2008, full length, Ukraine Delirium - 2013, full length, Ukraine, Czech Republic Merry-Go-Round - 2017, short length, Ukraine, Poland Visual arts Podolchak works in different genres of fine art - painting, prints, photography, video art and art actions. At the beginning of his career, the graphics prevailed, and from the mid-1990s makes art actions and performances, from the late 1990s video art. In the center of Podolchak's creativity, is a human body in its various manifestations, relationships with other bodies, as well as in different stages of decomposition. In the artistic development of the theme of decomposition and decay there are only two types of matter, two definite formations of \"flesh\" - human and architectural. They are the receptacles of all sorts of energies, the connections of various semiotic codes - the most clearly demonstrated manifestations of regressive forces. The propensity to the metamorphoses of decomposition reveals and, in a special way, mythologizes the \"corporeality\" of these two organisms, and the inconstancy of the point of view on their relations in this state (fluctuations from allegory to thriller), constantly improves the iconography of Podolchak's aesthetics in general.The artist's book Jacob Bohme was awarded as World's Best Book (Bronze Medal) by Stiftung Buchkunst Frankfurt am Main at Frankfurt Book Fair. One of his 24 personal exhibitions was the first art exhibition ever to be held in space, at space station Mir on January 25, 1993. Artworks of Podolchak can be found in 26 museums and public collections worldwide. Cinema Both Podolchak's films have common characteristic features: departure from narrative, anthropology of enclosed worlds, elaborated composition of frame, unusual shooting angles. The spaces of Las Meninas and Delirium are similarly dense, difficult for movement, tiresome both for the characters moving within them and the viewers watching them. This reflects the time of \"the end of history\" with its somnambulism, impotence, morbidity and hopelessness. Las Meninas Las Meninas is Podolchak's debut full-length film. He wrote, directed and produced it. The film had a world premiere at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in the competition program on January 25, 2008. Overall, it has participated in 27 international film festivals, including 10 competition programs. Delirium Delirium is Podolchak's second full-length feature. Its script is based on the story Inductor by the Ukrainian writer and journalist Dmytro Belyanskyi. The film's production lasted during 2008\u20132010. For the first time fragments of the film were demonstrated in 2012 on the 45th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the program Films in production.

Here he worked as a musical teacher from 1979 and later as professor and head of the percussion department.From the mid 1970s he was an active performer as drummer and he stepped in as timpanist in Trondheim Symphony Orchestra (1974\u201375). He was for many years associated with Oslo Filharmoniske Orkester and worked as regular drummer in the Orchestra of Den Norske Opera for some years. He worked within \"Ny Musikks Ensemble\" and later in contemporary music ensemble \"Octoband\".Samkopf's compositional output comprises nine full-length dance performances. He was also selected as the 1985 composer in residence for the Arctic Arts Festival. Smakopf's list of works features chamber music, orchestral works, electro-acoustic works, music for dance performances, soundtracks, TV-scores, educational works and a number of compositions for percussion. To date, Samkopf has received more than 40 commissions from institutions, ensembles and performers such as Harmonien, the Swedish Radio, Bergen Wind Quintet, NRK, Arts Council Norway, Collage Dance Company, Ultima Oslo Contemporary Music Festival, NorDans Productions, the Arctic Arts Festival, Eirik Raude and Kjell Tore Innervik.Compositions for dance constitutes a substantial portion of Samkopf's production. The composer has written the scores for nine full length dance productions. His artistic partnership with choreographer Lise Nordal is a cornerstone of this compositional vein. In addition to a number of shorter ballets, Samkopf and Nordal have created five full-length productions Aqua (1986), Tidevann (1990), Til Elise (1996), Entr\u00e9 (2000) and Silent Gliss (2004).Samkopf's compositional career has seen him evolving from writing for traditional instrumentation to gradually expand his tonal palette to include electronics and more unconventional sonorous objects. His two outdoor concerts held in Sandvika on 8 September 1991 and in Oslo on 3 October 1992 featured ten, large sound sculptures created by artist Sverre Hoel as the works\u00b4 main instrumentation. Samkopf's next developmental step is displayed on his two sonographic CD releases M\u00e5r\u00e5dalen Walk (1994) which features field recordings made by the composer in the Norwegian mountains, and Mountain Listening (1998) which is made up of five sonographic portraits of humans listening. These works also serve as a testament to Samkopf's focus on man's relation with nature. Additional key Samkopf releases includes 2002's Music for large Mountain and Vibraphone and 2010's Listening Ahead \u2013 Marimba & Town Hall.

While Shea served as a consultant for NASA on the redesign of the International Space Station in 1993, he was forced to resign from the position due to health issues.  Early life and education Shea was born September 5, 1925, and grew up in the Bronx, the eldest son in a working-class Irish Catholic family. His father worked as a mechanic on the New York City Subway. As a child, Shea had no interest in engineering; he was a good runner and hoped to become a professional athlete. He attended a Catholic high school and graduated when he was only sixteen.On graduating in 1943, Shea enlisted in the U.S. Navy and enrolled in a program that would put him through college. He began his studies at Dartmouth College, later moving to MIT and finally to the University of Michigan, where he would remain until he earned his Doctorate in 1955. In 1946, he was commissioned as an Ensign in the Navy and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics. Shea went on to earn a MSc (1950) and a Ph.D. (1955) in Engineering Mechanics from the University of Michigan. While obtaining his doctorate, Shea found the time to teach at the university and to hold down a job at Bell Labs. Systems engineer After receiving his doctorate, Shea took a position at Bell Labs in Whippany, New Jersey. There he first worked as systems engineer on the radio guidance system of the Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and then as the development and program manager on the inertial guidance system of the Titan II ICBM. Shea's specialty was systems engineering, a new type of engineering developed in the 1950s that focused on the management and integration of large-scale projects, turning the work of engineers and contractors into one functioning whole. He played a significant role in the Titan I project; as George Mueller writes, \"[H]e contributed a considerable amount of engineering innovation and project management skill and was directly responsible for the successful development of this pioneering guidance system.\" In addition to Shea's technical abilities, it quickly became obvious that he was also an excellent manager of people. Known for his quick intellect, he also endeared himself to his subordinates through small eccentricities such as his fondness for bad puns and habit of wearing red socks to important meetings. During the critical days of the Titan project Shea moved into the plant, sleeping on a cot in his office so as to be available at all hours if he was needed.Having brought in the project on time and on budget, Shea established a reputation in the aerospace community. In 1961 he was offered and accepted a position with Space Technology Laboratories, a division of TRW Inc., where he continued to work on ballistic missile systems. NASA career In December 1961, NASA invited Shea to interview for the position of deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF). D. Brainerd Holmes, Director of the OMSF, had been searching for a deputy who could offer expertise in systems engineering, someone with the technical abilities to supervise the Apollo program as a whole. Shea was recommended by one of Holmes' advisors, who had worked with him at Bell Labs. Although Shea had worked at Space Technology Labs for less than a year, he was captivated by the challenge offered by the NASA position. \"I could see they needed good people in the space program,\" he later said, \"and I was kind of cocky in those days.\" Lunar orbit rendezvous When Shea was hired by NASA, President John F. Kennedy's commitment to landing men on the Moon was still only seven months old, and many of the major decisions that shaped the Apollo program were yet to be made. Foremost among these was the mode that NASA would use to land on the Moon. When Shea first began to consider the issue in 1962, most NASA engineers and managers\u2014including Wernher von Braun, the director of the Marshall Space Flight Center\u2014favored either an approach called direct ascent, where the Apollo spacecraft would land on the Moon and return to the Earth as one unit, or Earth orbit rendezvous, where the spacecraft would be assembled while still in orbit around the Earth. However, dissenters such as John Houbolt, a Langley engineer, favored an approach that was then considered to be more risky: lunar orbit rendezvous, in which two spacecraft would be used. A command\/service module (CSM) would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a lunar module would land on the Moon and return to dock with the CSM in lunar orbit, then be discarded. In November 1961, John Houbolt had sent a paper advocating lunar orbit rendezvous (LOR) to Robert Seamans, the deputy administrator of NASA. As Shea remembered, \"Seamans gave a copy of Houbolt's letter to Brainerd Holmes [the director of OMSF]. Holmes put the letter on my desk and said: Figure it out.\" Shea became involved in the lunar orbit rendezvous decision as a result of this letter. While he began with a mild preference for earth orbit rendezvous, Shea \"prided himself\", according to space historians Murray and Cox, \"on going wherever the data took him\". In this case, the data took him to NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, where he met with John Houbolt and with the Space Task Group, and became convinced that LOR was an option worth considering.Shea's task now became to shepherd NASA to a firm decision on the issue. This task was complicated by the fact that he had to build consensus between NASA's different centers\u2014most notably the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston headed by Robert Gilruth, and the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, headed by Wernher von Braun. Relations between the centers were not good, and it was a major milestone in the progress of the Apollo program when von Braun and his team finally came to accept the superiority of the LOR concept. NASA announced its decision at a press conference on July 11, 1962, only six months after Shea had joined NASA. Space historian James Hansen concludes that Shea \"played a major role in supporting Houbolt's ideas and making the ... decision in favor of LOR\", while his former colleague George Mueller writes that \"it is a tribute to Joe's logic and leadership that he was able to build a consensus within the centers at a time when they were autonomous.\"During his time at the OMSF, Shea helped to resolve many of the other inevitable engineering debates and conflicts that cropped up during the development of the Apollo spacecraft. In May 1963, he formed a Panel Review Board, bringing together representatives of the many committees that aimed to coordinate work between NASA centers. Under Shea's leadership, this coordination became far more efficient. Program manager In October 1963, Shea became the new manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) in Houston. Although technically a demotion, this new position gave Shea the responsibility for managing the design and construction of the Apollo command and lunar modules. Of particular concern to Shea was the performance of North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the command module. As he later recounted: I do not have a high opinion of North American and their motives in the early days. Their first program manager was a first-class jerk. ... There were spots of good guys, but it was just an ineffective organization. They had no discipline, no concept of change control. It was Shea's responsibility to bring that engineering discipline to North American and to NASA's management of its contractors. His systems management experience served him well in his new post. In the coming years, any change to the design of the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Shea himself. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself\u2014a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.Shea's relationship with the engineers at North American was a difficult one. While Shea blamed North American's management for the continuing difficulties in the development of the command module, project leader Harrison Storms felt that NASA itself was far from blameless. It had delayed in making key design decisions, and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun. While Shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests, Storms felt that Shea did not understand or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the day-to-day work of manufacturing. Shea was a controversial figure even at the Manned Spacecraft Center. Not having been at Langley with the Space Task Group, he was considered an \"outsider\" by men such as flight director Chris Kraft, who recalled that \"the animosity between my people and Shea's was intense\". Relations between Shea and other NASA centers were even more uneasy. As the deputy director of OMSF, Shea had sought to extend the authority of NASA Headquarters over the fiercely independent NASA centers. This was particularly problematic when it came to the Marshall Space Flight Center, which had developed its own culture under Wernher von Braun. Von Braun's philosophy of engineering differed from Shea's, taking a consensual rather than top-down approach. As one historian recounts, von Braun felt that \"Shea had 'bitten off' too much work and was going to 'wreck' the centers engineering capabilities.\"The friction between Shea and Marshall, which had begun when Shea was at OMSF, continued after he moved to his new position. He became deeply involved in supporting George Mueller's effort to impose the idea of \"all up\" testing of the Saturn V rocket on the unwilling engineers at Marshall. Von Braun's approach to engineering was a conservative one, emphasizing the incremental testing of components. But the tight schedule of the Apollo program did not allow for this slow and careful process. What Mueller and Shea proposed was to test the Saturn V as one unit on its very first flight, and Marshall only reluctantly came to accept this approach in late 1963. When later asked how he and Mueller had managed to sell the idea to von Braun, Shea responded that \"we just told him that's the way it's going to be, finally.\"Shea's role in resolving differences within NASA, and between NASA and its contractors, placed him in a position where criticism was inevitable. However, even Shea's critics could not help but respect his engineering and management skills. Everyone who knew Shea considered him to be a brilliant engineer, and his time as manager at ASPO only served to solidify a reputation that had been formed during his time on the Titan project. Of Shea's work in the mid-1960s, Murray and Cox write that \"these were Joe Shea's glory days, and whatever the swirl of opinions about this gifted, enigmatic man, he was taking an effort that had been foundering and driving it forward.\" Shea's work also won wider attention, bringing him public recognition that approached that accorded to Wernher von Braun or Chris Kraft. Kraft had appeared on the cover of Time in 1965; Time planned to offer Shea the same honor in February 1967, the month in which the first manned Apollo mission was scheduled to occur. Apollo 1 fire Background Problems with the Apollo command module continued through the testing phase. The review meeting for the first spacecraft intended for a manned mission took place on August 19, 1966. One issue of concern was the amount of Velcro in the cabin, a potential fire hazard in the pure-oxygen atmosphere of the spacecraft, if there were to be a spark. As Shea later recounted: And so the issue was brought up at the acceptance of the spacecraft, a long drawn-out discussion. I got a little annoyed, and I said, \"Look, there's no way there's going to be a fire in that spacecraft unless there's a spark or the astronauts bring cigarettes aboard. We're not going to let them smoke.\" Well, I then issued orders at that meeting, \"Go clean up the spacecraft. Be sure that all the fire rules are obeyed.\" Although the spacecraft passed its review, the crew finished the meeting by presenting Shea with a picture of the three of them seated around a model of the capsule, heads bowed in prayer. The inscription was simple: It isn't that we don't trust you, Joe, but this time we've decided to go over your head. On January 25, 1967, the Apollo 1 crew began a series of countdown tests in the spacecraft on the pad at Cape Kennedy. Although Shea had ordered his staff to direct North American to take action on the issue of flammable materials in the cabin, he had not supervised the issue directly, and little if any action had been taken. During pad testing, the spacecraft suffered a number of technical problems, including broken and static-filled communications. Wally Schirra, the backup commander for the mission, suggested to Shea that Shea should go through the countdown test in the spacecraft with the crew in order to experience first-hand the issues that they were facing. Although he seriously considered the idea, it proved to be unworkable because of the difficulties of hooking up a fourth communications loop for Shea. The hatch would have to be left open in order to run the extra wires out, and leaving the hatch open would make it impossible to run the emergency egress test that had been scheduled for the end of the day on the 27th. As Shea later told the press, joining the crew for the test would have been \"highly irregular\".A \"plugs-out\" spacecraft test, simulating the launch countdown, took place on January 27. While Shea was in Florida for the beginning of the test, he decided to leave before it concluded. He arrived back at his office in Houston at about 5:30 p.m. CST. At 5:31 p.m. CST (6:31 p.m. EST) a massive fire broke out in the Apollo command module. Unable to escape, the three astronauts inside the spacecraft, Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee, were killed. Investigation Immediately after the fire, Shea and his ASPO colleagues at Houston boarded a NASA plane to the Kennedy Space Center. They landed at about 1:00 a.m., only five hours after the fire had broken out. At a meeting that morning with Robert Gilruth, George Mueller and George Low, Shea helped to determine the individuals who would be on the NASA review board looking into the causes of the fire. Additionally, he persuaded George Mueller, head of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, to allow him to act as Mueller's deputy in Florida, supervising the progress of the investigation.Named to the advisory group chosen to support the review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, it soon became clear that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any material\u2014including Velcro, with which the cabin was filled\u2014would instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home. Breakdown The pressure of the investigation took a psychological toll on Shea. He had trouble sleeping and began to resort to barbiturates and alcohol in order to help himself cope. Shea was not the only NASA employee who found the aftermath of the fire difficult to handle: Robert Seamans wrote that \"key people from Houston would fly up to Washington to testify and literally sob all the way on the plane\", and a man who worked under Shea suffered a nervous breakdown and was reportedly taken to a mental hospital in a straitjacket. A few weeks after the fire, Shea's colleagues began to notice that he too was behaving erratically. Chris Kraft, whose father had suffered from schizophrenia, later related Shea's behavior in one meeting: Joe Shea got up and started calmly with a report on the state of the investigation. But within a minute, he was rambling, and in another thirty seconds, he was incoherent. I looked at him and saw my father, in the grip of dementia praecox. It was horrifying and fascinating at the same time. NASA administrator James Webb became increasingly worried about Shea's mental state. Specifically, he was concerned that Shea might not be able to deal with the hostile questioning that he would receive from the congressional inquiry into the Apollo 1 fire. Senator Walter Mondale had accused NASA engineers of \"criminal negligence\" with regard to the design and construction of the Apollo command module, and it was expected that Shea would be in the firing line. In March, Webb sent Robert Seamans and Charles Berry, NASA's head physician, to speak with Shea and ask him to take an extended voluntary leave of absence. This would, they hoped, protect him from being called to testify. A press release had already been prepared, but Shea refused, threatening to resign rather than take leave. As a compromise, he agreed to meet with a psychiatrist and to abide by an independent assessment of his psychological fitness. Yet this approach to removing Shea from his position was also unsuccessful. As one of his friends later recounted: The psychiatrists came back saying, 'He's so smart, he's so intelligent!' Here Joe was, ready to kill himself, but he could still outsmart the psychiatrists. Reassignment At that point, Shea's superiors felt forced to take a more direct approach. On April 7 it was announced that Shea would be transferred to NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C. to serve as George Mueller's deputy in the Office of Manned Space Flight. He was replaced as chief of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office by George Low While Shea had already acted as Mueller's de facto deputy in Florida during the investigation, the reality of this permanent posting was very different. When Shea's reassignment was announced, one of his friends gave an anonymous interview to Time magazine in which he said that \"if Joe stays in Washington, it'll be a promotion. If he leaves in three or four months, you'll know this move amounted to being fired.\"Shea accepted the reassignment reluctantly, feeling that \"it was as if NASA was trying to hide me from the Congress for what I might have said\". Once in the job, he grew increasingly dissatisfied with a posting that he considered to be a \"non-job\", later commenting that \"I don't understand why, after everything I had done for the program ... I was only one that was removed. That's the end of the program for me.\" Only six months after the fire, and some two months after taking his new position, Shea left NASA in order to become a Vice President at the Polaroid Corporation in Waltham, Massachusetts. He was never called to testify before the congressional inquiry into the fire. Post-NASA career In 1968, Shea took a position at Raytheon in Lexington, Massachusetts. He would remain with the company until his retirement in 1990, serving as Senior Vice President for Engineering from 1981 through 1990. After leaving Raytheon, Shea became an adjunct professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT.In February 1993, NASA administrator Daniel Goldin appointed Shea to the chairmanship of a technical review board convened to oversee the redesign of the troubled International Space Station. However, Shea was hospitalized shortly after his appointment. By April he was well enough to attend a meeting where the design team formally presented the preliminary results of its studies, but his behavior at the meeting again called his capacities into question. As The Washington Post reported: Shea made a rambling, sometimes barely audible two-hour presentation that left many of those present speculating about his ability to do the job. A longtime friend said, \"That's not the real Joe Shea. He is normally incisive and well-organized.\" On the day following the meeting, Shea offered his resignation, becoming instead a special advisor to Goldin. NASA reported that he had resigned due to health reasons. However, The Scientist offered a different interpretation, quoting sources who speculated that the bluntness of his speech, including criticisms of Goldin, may have been controversial in NASA circles.Shea died on February 14, 1999, at his home in Weston, Massachusetts. He was survived by his wife Carol, six daughters, and one son.

Early life Julius Wagner-Jauregg was born Julius Wagner on 7 March 1857 in Wels, Upper Austria, the son of Adolph Johann Wagner and Ludovika Jauernigg Ranzoni. His family name was changed to \"Wagner von Jauregg\" when his father was given the title of \"Ritter von Jauregg\" (a hereditary title of nobility) in 1883 by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Hence he retained the name Julius Wagner Ritter von Jauregg until 1918 when the empire was dissolved, and nobility was abolished. The family name was then contracted to \"Wagner-Jauregg\". He attended the Schottengymnasium in Vienna before going on to study Medicine at the University of Vienna from 1874 to 1880, where he also studied with Salomon Stricker in the Institute of General and Experimental Pathology. He obtained his doctorate in 1880 with the thesis \"L'origine et la fonction du c\u0153ur acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9.\" He left the institute in 1882. Later years After leaving the clinic, he conducted laboratory experiments with animals, which was practiced very little at this time. From 1883 to 1887 he worked with Maximilian Leidesdorf in the Psychiatric Clinic, although his original training was not in the pathology of the nervous system. In 1889 he succeeded the famous Richard von Krafft-Ebing at the Neuro-Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Graz, and started his research on Goitre, cretinism and iodine. In 1893 he became Extraordinary Professor of Psychiatry and Nervous Diseases, and Director of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Nervous Diseases in Vienna, as successor to Theodor Meynert. A student and assistant of Wagner-Jauregg during this time was Constantin von Economo. Ten years later, in 1902, Wagner-Jauregg moved to the psychiatric clinic at the General Hospital and in 1911 he returned to his former post. In 1935, he was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. Nobel prize The main work pursued by Wagner-Jauregg throughout his life was related to the treatment of mental disease by inducing a fever, an approach known as pyrotherapy. In 1887 he investigated the effects of febrile diseases on psychoses, making use of erisipela and tuberculin (discovered in 1890 by Robert Koch). Since these methods of treatment did not work very well, he tried in 1917 the inoculation of malaria parasites, which proved to be very successful in the case of dementia paralytica (also called general paresis of the insane), caused by neurosyphilis, at that time a terminal disease. It had been observed that some who develop high fevers could be cured of syphilis. Thus, from 1917 to the mid 1940s, malaria induced by the least aggressive parasite, Plasmodium vivax, was used as treatment for tertiary syphilis because it produced prolonged and high fevers (a form of pyrotherapy). This was considered an acceptable risk because the malaria could later be treated with quinine, which was available at that time. This discovery earned him the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1927. His main publication was a book titled Verh\u00fctung und Behandlung der progressiven Paralyse durch Impfmalaria (Prevention and treatment of progressive paralysis by malaria inoculation) in the Memorial Volume of the Handbuch der experimentellen Therapie, (1931). The technique was known as malariotherapy; however, it was dangerous, killing about 15% of patients, so it is no longer in use. Sex treatment for psychosis Wagner-Jauregg administered thyroid and ovarian preparations to young psychotic patients who had experienced delayed puberty, which led to the development of their secondary sexual characteristics and diminished psychosis. Other patients were deemed schizophrenic because of excessive masturbation, where Wagner-Jauregg sterilized them, resulting in an \"improved\" condition. Retirement In 1928, Wagner-Jauregg retired from his post but remained active and in good health until his death on 27 September 1940. In his retirement he published nearly 80 scientific papers. Many schools, roads and hospitals are named after him in Austria. Nazi ideology and affiliation Towards his last days Wagner-Jauregg was influenced by Hitler's German nationalism, and became an anti-Semite and sympathizer of Nazism. Documentary evidence indicates that he supported the Nazi party shortly after the invasion of Austria in 1938 by Germany. However, a denazification commission in Austria found that his application for NSDAP membership had been refused \"...on grounds of race\", as his first wife Balbine Frumkin was Jewish.Wagner-Jauregg advocated a racial hygiene ideology called eugenics, influencing students such as Alexander Pilcz, who went on to author a standard handbook on racial psychiatry critical of Jews for being prone to mental illness.He was also an advocate of forced sterilization of the mentally ill and criminal, having endorsed the concept in 1935 while a member of the Austrian Anthropological Society.He was President of the Austrian League for Racial Regeneration and Heredity, which advocated sterilization for those of inferior genetics.

He was awarded his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1943, at the age of 23, with a dissertation on An Investigation of the Shock Wave Produced by an Explosion in Air. On July 17, 1943 he was married to scientist Lilli Hornig. The couple had four children together: three girls, Joanna, Ellen, and Leslie, and one boy, Christopher. After graduating, he started work at the Underwater Explosives Laboratory of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. While there, according to one obituary, he received an invitation to begin a new job, but he was not told what his duties would be, nor, initially, to where he would relocate. At first he refused, but Harvard University President James B. Conant helped persuade him to reconsider. Thus, he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory, where he was a group leader in the Manhattan Project. He worked on the firing unit that was used for the implosion of the plutonium device. He helped prepare the first atomic bomb, Trinity, and witnessed its explosion, the first detonation of a nuclear device. He was sent up to the top of the tower twice the previous day to reassure a nervous Robert Oppenheimer that all was well.In 1946 he joined the staff of Brown University as an assistant professor, and became a full professor in 1951. From 1951 to 1952 he was Associate Dean of the Graduate School, then acting dean the following year.

Biography Born and raised in Wisconsin, Knox received her bachelor's degree in medical laboratory sciences from Marquette University and was board certified by the American Society for Clinical Pathology in 1977. After receiving a master's degree in business management in 1990, Knox entered the Medical College of Wisconsin's graduate pathology program as a doctoral student in 1992, where she investigated the pathogenetic interactions between HIV and HHV-6 as her doctoral dissertation research project under Donald Carrigan with whom she collaborated on various publications during the period. She received her PhD in 1994. Founding Viracor In 1996 Knox and Carrigan founded the Wisconsin Viral Research Group (WVRG), located in the Milwaukee County Research Park. In 2000 they incorporated Viracor as a spinoff of WVRG and hired Phillip Short as the founding CEO to manage business aspect of Viracor in exchange of a minority stake, according to Milwaukee County records. Viracor grew revenues to more than $25 million per year by 2008 with more than 100 employees. In summer of 2009 Viracor was acquired by IBT Labs for US$44 Million in cash and a further unspecified amount of stock. By 2014, Viracor-IBT Laboratories was valued at US$255 Million, when it was acquired by Eurofins Scientific Group. As Viracor expanded Knox focused on WVRG and expanded research outside United States. Through WVRG, Knox collaborates with various research and philanthropic organizations to offer free research grants and develop research institutes. Knox also runs the not-for-profit Institute for Viral Pathogenesis (IVP), which has successfully obtained research grants from major funding organizations for virological studies in patients with multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. Recognition Knox was named fifth of the 50 most innovative AIDS researchers in the United States in 1996 by POZ magazine in its \"Survey of the American Scientific Landscape\". In their recognition, survey authors Bob Lederer and Patrick Pacheco said Knox calls HHV-6 variant A \"a big, dumb brute destroyer of tissue,\" which she and Carrigan had in their crosshairs. The National CFIDS Foundation (NCF) awarded its largest research grant to Knox, for \u201cThe Potential Role of New Infectious Agents in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\u201d. NCF medical director Alan Cocchetto said that Knox and her partner had assisted the NCF with previous projects that included research into the roles of HHV-6A\/B and HTLV-II in CFS\/ME. Knox's work on the role of human herpesvirus six (HHV-6) in chronic diseases also led her to be named the 1995 Distinguished Alumna of the Program in Medical Laboratory Sciences at Marquette University.

His family moved, in 1923, to Lorain, Ohio, and again in 1925, to Detroit, Michigan, where his father changed the family's name to Evans.Throughout his early life, Lateef came into contact with many Detroit-based jazz musicians who gained prominence, including vibraphonist Milt Jackson, bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Elvin Jones and guitarist Kenny Burrell. Lateef was a proficient saxophonist by the time of his graduation from high school at the age of 18, when he launched his professional career and began touring with a number of swing bands. The first instrument he bought was an alto saxophone but after a year he switched to the tenor saxophone, influenced by the playing of Lester Young.In 1949, he was invited by Dizzy Gillespie to tour with his orchestra. In 1950, Lateef returned to Detroit and began his studies in composition and flute at Wayne State University. It was during this period that he converted to Islam as a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and changed his name. He twice made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Prominence Lateef began recording as a leader in 1957 for Savoy Records, a non-exclusive association which continued until 1959; the earliest of Lateef's album's for the Prestige subsidiary New Jazz overlap with them. Musicians such as Wilbur Harden (trumpet, flugelhorn), bassist Herman Wright, drummer Frank Gant, and pianist Hugh Lawson were among his collaborators during this period. In 1960, they played an extended gig at the Minor Key, a non-alcoholic club at Dexter and Burlingame in Detroit.By 1961, with the recording of Into Something and Eastern Sounds, Lateef's dominant presence within a group context had emerged. His \"Eastern\" influences are clearly audible in all of these recordings, with spots for instruments like the rahab, shanai, arghul, koto and a collection of Chinese wooden flutes and bells along with his tenor and flute. Even his use of the western oboe sounds exotic in this context; it is not a standard jazz instrument. Indeed, the tunes themselves are a mixture of jazz standards, blues and film music usually performed with a piano\/bass\/drums rhythm section in support. Lateef made numerous contributions to other people's albums, including during his period as a member of saxophonist Cannonball Adderley's Quintet during 1962\u201364.In the late 1960s, he began to incorporate contemporary soul and gospel phrasing into his music (albeit with a strong blues underlay) on albums such as Detroit and Hush 'N' Thunder, presaging the emergence of jazz fusion. Lateef expressed a dislike of the terms \"jazz\" and \"jazz musician\" as musical generalizations. As is so often the case with such generalizations, the use of these terms do understate the breadth of his sound. In the 1980s, Lateef experimented with new-age and spiritual elements. In 1960, Lateef returned to school, studying flute at the Manhattan School of Music in New York City. He received a bachelor's degree in music in 1969 and a master's degree in music education in 1970. Starting in 1971, he taught courses in \"autophysiopsychic music\" at the Manhattan School of Music, and he became an associate professor at the Borough of Manhattan Community College in 1972. In 1975, Lateef received an Ed.D. from the University of Massachusetts Amherst; his dissertation was a comparative study of Western and Islamic education. Thereafter, Lateef served as a senior research fellow at the Center for Nigerian Cultural Studies at Ahmadu Bello University throughout the early 1980s. Returning to the United States in 1986, he took a joint faculty appointment at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Hampshire College. Later career His 1987 album Yusef Lateef's Little Symphony won the Grammy Award for Best New Age Recording His core influences, however, were clearly rooted in jazz, and in his own words: \"My music is jazz.\"In 1992, Lateef founded YAL Records. In 1993, Lateef was commissioned by the WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne to compose The African American Epic Suite, a four-part work for orchestra and quartet based on themes of slavery and disfranchisement in the United States. The piece has since been performed by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. In 2005, Nicolas Humbert & Werner Penzel, directors of Step Across The Border, filmed Brother Yusef, in his wooden house in the middle of a forest in Massachusetts. In 2010 he received the lifetime Jazz Master Fellowship Award from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), an independent federal agency. Established in 1982, the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award is the highest honor given in jazz.The Manhattan School of Music, where Lateef had earned a bachelor's and a master's degree, awarded Lateef its Distinguished Alumni Award in 2012. Lateef's last albums were recorded for Adam Rudolph's Meta Records. To the end of his life, he continued to teach at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Smith College, and Hampshire College in western Massachusetts. Lateef died of prostate cancer on the morning of December 23, 2013, at the age of 93, survived by his wife, Ayesha, and son, Yusef.Following his death, Lateef's family auctioned off many of his instruments, in the hopes that they would continue to be played. Woodwind player Jeff Coffin purchased Lateef's main tenor saxophone as well as his bass flute.In October 2020, the UMass Fine Arts Center celebrated the centenary of Lateef's birth by producing \"Yusef Lateef: A Centenary Celebration,\" a major online exhibit of his work curated by Glenn Siegel and others. The centenary includes \"100 Responses to Yusef Lateef,\" a series of video tributes by many prominent artists and former Lateef collaborators and students. Discography Personal life Lateef said what he remembered most about his childhood was \"My passion for nature.\"In 1980, Lateef declared that he would no longer perform any place where alcohol was served. In 1999, he said: \"Too much blood, sweat and tears have been spilled creating this music to play it where people are smoking, drinking and talking.\"Lateef's first wife, Tahira, predeceased him, as did a son and a daughter.

Family and early life Herbert Blakiston was born in Hastings the son of artist, Douglas Yeoman Blakiston and Sophia Matilda Dent. His father subsequently became a clergyman and the family moved to the vicarage of St Swithun's Church, East Grinstead. Blackstone was a descendant of Sir Matthew Blakiston, the Lord Mayor of London from 1760\u20131761; he was the great-grandson of Sir Matthew Blakiston, 2nd Baronet Blakiston. Herbert Blakiston was the eldest of six children, he had two sisters and three brothers. All four brothers attended Tonbridge School, with Herbert being there from 1876 to 1881. As he wore glasses, he acquired the nickname \"Blinks\" in school, which followed him for the remainder of his life.One of the brothers, Charles, was killed in a firearm accident at the age of 24 in October 1887. A house surgeon at the Salop Infirmary, Shrewsbury, Charles was accidentally shot in the back while hunting rabbits with a colleague. The youngest brother, William, was 19 when he accidentally fell under a train at Charing Cross Station on the night of 1 October 1889, and died in hospital some days later. The third brother, John, was a telegraph clerk. He was one of seven killed while defending Mazowe, Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) on 18 June 1896 at the start of the Second Matabele War.In 1908 the vicarage at East Grinsted was destroyed in a fire, leaving Douglas Blakiston liable for \u00a31000 as the building was under-insured. Herbert Blakiston's sisters, Mabel and Emily, died in 1910 and 1912. His mother also died in 1912, and his father died in 1914. Academic career Blakiston matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, in October 1881. He gaining a first class degree in Literae Humaniores in 1885. He was ordained and became Fellow, Chaplain, and Lecturer at Trinity College in 1887. He then became Tutor in 1892, Senior Tutor and Junior Bursar in 1898, before being elected President of the College in March 1907. He also served simultaneously as Estates Bursar (1915\u201338). Blakiston was not the college fellows' first choice for the presidency. Robert Rapier was the preferred candidate but he turned the position down, citing his advancing age as an obstacle. During his presidency, Blakiston continued in the role of chaplain and sometimes conducted services in the Trinity College chapel.Outside of Trinity College, Blakiston had also been appointed University Proctor in 1899. He was the university auditor from 1903 to 1917 and a became a member of the Hebdomadal Council in 1915.During World War I, many Trinity staff and students left to join the armed forces. By 1918, there were just nine undergraduates in residence. Blakiston became the university's Vice-Chancellor in 1917 and did much to improve its finances, which had been placed under strain by the war as the university, in his words, was \"almost empty\". He was effective in this role although his health was affected by the strain of the additional responsibilities.Blakiston was devoted to his college and its students. He had the lifelong habit of keeping clippings from The Times that mentioned any former student. He was badly affected by the deaths of 155 Trinity men during World War 1, many known to him personally. In many cases, he personally visited the families of former-students who had been killed to offer condolences. After the War, he devoted much effort to a new library that was to be their memorial. He wrote 1200 letters asking for donations, partially designed the building himself and paid five percent of its cost from his own pocket. The building was eventually completed in 1928. Blakiston was later described as unsociable, snobbish, parsimonious and obsessed with finance. He had few close friends and made enemies easily. His racism was notable even by the standards of the time and he became notorious for it. He was strongly against Oxford degrees being awarded to women, which began while he served as university Vice\u2013Chancellor and in spite of all he could to do oppose it. The central character Theodore Fletcher, in Joanna Cannan's 1931 satirical novel High Table, was a thinly-disguised, cruel caricature of him.During his presidency, Blakiston was largely responsible for college admissions and developed a particular notoriety for refusing applications to Trinity from non-white candidates. Notably, he stubbornly resisted pressure from the India Office to admit undergraduates from British India, something that government department was attempting to promote. During this time, the traditional rivalry between Trinity and Balliol College took on a racial tone as Balliol admitted a number of Asian students.Although he was under no compulsion to retire from the College Presidency, he did so on 1 September 1938, having held the post for 31 years. He was succeeded by John Weaver. Later life After living at Trinity College for 57 years, Blakiston moved to Boars Hill, near Oxford. On 28 July 1942, he was struck by a car while walking in Boars Hill; he died the next day in the Radcliffe Infirmary without regaining consciousness. His funeral took place in the Trinity College chapel and his ashes were interred in the antechapel. He left \u00a3100,055 in his will. His bequests were to Oxford University and Trinity College for the purchase of works of art.Trinity College owns two portraits of him. One painted in 1932 by the chemist Cyril Norman Hinshelwood and one painted from a photograph in 1943 by Allan Gwynne-Jones. Works Blakiston wrote articles for the Dictionary of National Biography, including the entry for the explorer Thomas Blakiston. In 1894, he wrote an English translation of several of Cicero's works, including the Catiline Orations and Pro Milone. He wrote a brief work on Durham College, Oxford and a meticulously-researched history of Trinity College that was published in 1898. A small print\u2013run of his history of the Blakiston family was published in 1928. He also wrote a collection of ghost stories in Latin.

He played college football at Louisiana State University.  Early years LaFleur attended Westlake High School, where he played tight end and defensive end. He also practiced basketball and track. As a junior, he had 31 receptions for 657 yards and 8 touchdowns. In his last year, he posted 31 receptions for 652 yards and 5 touchdowns, while being named the Louisiana High School player of the year, All-American, and being part of the USA Today All-USA high school football team. He finished his high school career with 81 receptions for 1,758 yards and 18 touchdowns. College career LaFleur accepted a football scholarship from Louisiana State University. As a redshirt freshman, he played in every game with his first start coming against the University of Florida, while making 8 receptions for 59 yards. His blocking was so impressive, that as a sophomore after having only 21 receptions (fourth on the team) for 263 yards and 2 touchdowns, he was still voted All-SEC. He also was the first Tiger tight end since 1984 to score twice in a game, as he recorded 3 receptions for 59 yards with touchdown receptions of 35 and 12 yards against the University of Southern Mississippi. As a junior, he registered 12 receptions for 120 yards, after missing 3 games with a knee injury. As a senior, he had 30 catches for 439 yards and 3 touchdowns, becoming the first school tight end to lead the team in receiving since 1980. At the end of the season, he was named All-American, All-SEC, LSU offensive MVP and played in the Senior Bowl. He finished his career with 71 receptions for 881 yards and 5 touchdowns, while starting 28 out of his final 30 games and being active in a total of 41 contests. Professional career After the team's offense suffered because of the health of Jay Novacek and the lack of production at tight end, the Dallas Cowboys were determined to solve the situation in the 1997 NFL Draft, even going as far as soliciting quarterback's Troy Aikman input in private workouts of the two top ranked players at the position (Tony Gonzalez and LaFleur), that were reported by the Sports Illustrated magazine. It was eventually published in the media that both the Cowboys and Aikman, had him rated ahead of Gonzalez, because they considered him to possess a rare combination of skills.The Cowboys traded up with the Philadelphia Eagles moving from the 25th to the 22nd position, in exchange for third (#70-Brian Alford) and fifth round (#155-Luther Broughton) draft choices, to select LaFleur in the first round (22nd overall). As a rookie, he complemented veteran Eric Bjornson, mostly blocking for the team (recording five pancake blocks in one game), because his receiving production was disappointing, making 18 receptions for 122 yards, 6.8 yards average and 2 touchdowns. In 1998, he was named the starter, posting 20 receptions (fifth on the team) for 176 yards and 2 touchdowns (tied for third on the team). Against the New Orleans Saints, he suffered a sprained PCL in his right knee, which forced him to miss the last 3 games. He returned in the playoffs against the Arizona Cardinals, but did not record a reception in the 7-20 loss. In 1999, during the offseason he suffered a broken right fibula in minicamp and underwent a microscopic lumbar discectomy to repair a herniated disc. He still was able to have the best season of his short career, registering 35 receptions for 322 yards, while leading the NFC tight ends and his team with 7 touchdowns, becoming just the second tight end in franchise history to reach this number.In 2000, besides a groin and ankle injury that affected him during the season, LaFleur had back problems that dated back to his college years and it started to affect his play. He was passed on the depth chart by veteran Jackie Harris, while registering only 12 receptions for 109 yards and one touchdown in 15 games (10 starts).On August 21, 2001, he was waived injured when he failed a physical exam with a herniated disk in his back. He finished his career with 85 receptions for 729 yards and 12 touchdowns in 60 games (44 starts).

Mudie's efficient distribution system and vast supply of texts revolutionized the circulating library movement, while his \"select\" library influenced Victorian middle-class values and the structure of the three-volume novel. He was also the first publisher of James Russell Lowell's poems in England, and of Emerson's Man Thinking.\n\n  Early life Charles Edward Mudie was born in 1818 to Scottish parents in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. He received most of his education by assisting in the family newspaper shop until he was twenty-two. In 1840, Mudie opened his first shop on Upper King Street, Bloomsbury. Mudie's Lending Library Mudie originally opened his circulating library to give the public greater access to non-fiction works \u2014 which comprised nearly one third of his stock \u2014 but the market value of the novel brought him financial success. In 1842, he began to lend books, charging subscribers one guinea per year for the right to borrow one exchangeable volume of a novel at a time. (At that time, other book-lenders charged between four and ten guineas.) Mudie's model proved so successful that in 1852 he moved his \"Select Library\" to larger premises at 509, 510 & 511 New Oxford Street, at its junction with Museum Street and Hart Street, just a few yards south of the British Museum. The Vienna Caf\u00e9, a haunt of artists and writers using the British Museum Reading Room, stood opposite the library on New Oxford Street. Mudie's soon had outlets on Cross Street in Manchester and on New Street in Birmingham.London book deliveries were carried out by vans, and the expansion of railroads and trains allowed people to order books across the country. International orders were also issued and shipped abroad in tin boxes. Mudie's also exported books using watertight boxes, some of which were reported to have survived shipwreck.Mudie was able to offer publishers advance purchase of three or four hundred copies of their new books, and he obtained corresponding discounts. The company's withdrawn books were offered for sale at \u00a35 for a hundred volumes in 1860.In the Victorian era, the cost of novels exceeded the means of most middle-class Englishmen, so popular lending-libraries like Mudie's had a strong influence over the public \u2014 and thus over authors and publishers. Mudie's demands that fiction novels be suited to the middle-class family controlled the morality, subject, and scope of the novel for fifty years. His \"select\" books were carefully chosen with these his standards in mind; once the Mudie Library considered a book unfit for its customers, other libraries followed suit. The rise of the three-volume novel can be directly attributed to this influence, and Mudie's refusal to stock immoral books and \"novels of questionable character or inferior quality\", such as George Moore's A Modern Lover (1883), A Mummer's Wife (1885) and A Drama in Muslin (1886), also had an effect on the direction of Victorian literature. George Moore criticized the moral and structural power the circulating library system had on literary distribution. His response to censorship was to issue a number of polemics against circulating libraries, the most popular being Literature at Nurse, or Circulating Morals. He confronted Mudie on why the librarian refused to sell A Modern Lover. Mudie's response:\"Your book was considered immoral. Two ladies from the country wrote to me objecting to that scene where the girl sat to the artist as a model for Venus. After that I naturally refused to circulate your book, unIess any customer said he wanted particularly to read Mr. Moore's novel.\" Mudie was also crucial in the success of scientific volumes \u2013 In November 1859 he bought 500 copies of the first publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. In fact, much of Darwin's own reading was obtained from Mudie's nonfiction collection. His five-guinea annual subscription allowed him to borrow a parcel of up to six recently-published books a month.In 1860 the company's New Oxford Street premises were substantially enlarged, and new branches of the business were subsequently established in other English cities such as York, Manchester, and Birmingham. (Competitors of Mudie's in London in the 1870s included circulating libraries of Bolton, Day, Miles, Rolandi, W.H. Smith & Sons, and United.) In 1864 Mudie's was converted into a limited company. On August 18, 1871, directors of Mudie's Select Library (Limited) acquired control of the English and Foreign Library (formerly known as Hookham's). Mudie's library continued into the 1930s. The decline of Mudie's eventually came as a result of the rising number of government-funded public libraries, which offered similar services at a much-reduced rate. In literature and popular culture Mudie's Library is mentioned in the H. G. Wells classic The Invisible Man: \"We crawled past Mudie's, and there a tall woman with five or six yellow-labelled books hailed my cab, and I sprang out just in time to escape her, shaving a railway van narrowly in my flight. I made off up the roadway to Bloomsbury Square, intending to strike north past the Museum and so get into the quiet district.\" Virginia Woolf refers to Mudie's Library several times in her 1922 novel Jacob's Room. From chapter 9: \"Time is issued to spinster ladies of wealth in long white ribbons. These they wind round and round, round and round, assisted by five female servants, a butler, a fine Mexican parrot, regular meals, Mudie's library, and friends dropping in.\" The manga Emma, which takes place in Victorian England, features Mudie's Lending Library. In W. S. Gilbert\u2019s Bab Ballads, naval Captain Reece is praised for promoting the comfort of his crew: \"New volumes came across the sea \/ From MISTER MUDIE'S libraree; \/ The Times and Saturday Review \/ Beguiled the leisure of the crew.\" In The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde, first produced in 1895, young Cecily Cardew, ward of a well-to-do gentleman living in Hertfordshire, speaking to her teacher Miss Prism about \"memory\" says that \"it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and couldn't possibly have happened. I believe that Memory is responsible for nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends to us.\" Act II, Sc. 1. Mudie\u2019s Library\u2014and the reading of novels in general\u2014are mentioned frequently throughout the six Palliser novels by Anthony Trollope. In Can You Forgive Her?, Alice, newly arrived at Matching Priory, informs Jeffrey Palliser: \"I have amused myself by reading.\" \"Ah; they never do that here. I have heard that there is a library, but the clue to it has been lost, and nobody now knows the way. I don\u2019t believe in libraries. Nobody ever goes into a library to read, any more than you would into a larder to eat. But there is this difference;\u2014the food you consume does come out of the larders, but the books you read never come out of the libraries.\" \"Except Mudie\u2019s,\" said Alice.In The Prime Minister, among the shameful economies Ferdinand Lopez forces his wife, Emily Wharton, to endure is the cancellation of their subscription to Mudie\u2019s.

He primarily concentrated on Malayalam films.  Career After completing his graduation Pavithran made two unsuccessful attempts to get admission at the Pune Film Institute. This failure made him join a Law College nearby the film institute at Pune. Instead of studying law, he spent his time in the Film Institute seeing world classics and how films were made. He used this opportunity to befriend the institute students and understand cinema closely. His friendship with director P. A. Backer led to the making of the film Kabani Nadi Chuvannappol (When the River Kabani Turned Red, 1975), which he produced. He made his directorial debut with Yaro Oral (Someone, 1978) for which G. Aravindan composed the music. The film was about the travails of urban life and identity crisis in the city. It introduced to Malayalam a genre of personal cinema, which is deliberately anti-realist. This won state awards for Best Direction, Best Editing and Best Cinematography. In 1981, he composed the music for T. V. Chandran's directorial debut Krishnankutty. Later he made a shift in his form of filmmaking with Uppu (Salt, 1986), where he adopted the middle-stream cinema model. In Uppu, he told the story of the atavistic Muslim practice of male polygamy. It became controversial upon release. In an interview, Pavithran commented, \"Salt is a trifle better - the truth always is. The religious laws are almost unknowingly misused by people, leading to the exploitation of those who succumb or resign themselves to religious and social pressures. Our intention was not to victimise or ridicule a minority.\" Uppu won the National Film Award for Best Regional Film. In 1989, he directed Utharam which was written by M. T. Vasudevan Nair and featured Mammootty in the lead role. The film is about the investigative journey that the protagonist embarks on in order to find the reasons behind a poet's suicide, a bizarre step she took despite her picture-perfect life. The film became a major commercial and critical success. It has earned cult status and is now regarded as one of the best investigative thriller films in Malayalam cinema.His last film Kuttappan Sakshi (Kuttappan, the Witness, 2002) begins in the pre-independence era when the communist movement was coming up in Kerala and inspiring poor peasants and other workers to raise their voice against the feudalism and the exploitation of the Nampoothiris. Death Pavithran died on 26 February 2006. He was married to Kalamandalam Kshemavathy, with whom he had two daughters, Eva, an actress in South Indian films, and Lakshmi.

As a teenager, Mbeki worked as a newsboy and messenger in the cities, and because of this, he saw the poverty urban black Africans lived in, and the constant police raids they endured. He attended Fort Hare University, completing in 1936 a Bachelor of Arts degree in politics and psychology and a teaching diploma. Mbeki met other African struggle leaders while attending the university. Teacher, trader and communist For a time Mbeki worked as a teacher, but lost his job because of his political activities.

His role in the CPSA\/ SACP was clandestine at the time, which helps explain why he received the nomination. Mbeki disparagingly referred to the council as a 'toy telephone': \"You can say what you like, but your words have no effect because the wires are not connected to an exchange\". In 1948 Mbeki stood as a candidate for the Natives Representative Council but lost the election.When the CPSA\/ SACP was banned in 1950 by the apartheid government, Mbeki remained in the African National Congress (ANC). In 1952 Mbeki was imprisoned together with Raymond Mhlaba and Vuyisile Mini for three months in Rooi Hel ('Red Hell' or North End Prison, Port Elizabeth) for disobeying apartheid laws by participating in the 'Campaign of Defiance against Injustice Laws' (Defiance Campaign). In 1954, a tornado destroyed his store, and Mbeki was dismissed from teaching again (he would lose his job three times, and be blacklisted from others, from the 1930s onwards). Mbeki moved to Port Elizabeth and joined the editorial board of New Age, a prominent leftist newspaper linked to underground CPSA\/ SACP networks. Mbeki played a crucial role in ensuring that the pages and columns reflected the conditions, demands, and aspirations of black working-class people, particularly in the countryside.He also worked on the Guardian, New Age, Fighting Talk and Liberation, and worked with 'Jock' Harold Strachan in the Port Elizabeth area, and helped him produce the newsletter Izwe Lomzi (\"Voice of the People\"). Mbeki was meanwhile actively involved in the major campaigns of the day, including the revival of the African National Congress in the 1940s, the Defiance Campaign and the Congress of the People. Armed struggle and Robben Island In 1960, the ANC was banned, and along with the underground SACP, formed Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), which became ANC's armed wing. Mbeki was involved, and, at his urging, Strachan assisted MK by turning his hand to improvised explosive devices based on substances like potassium permanganate, magnesium, glycerol and icing sugar. ...this was our job \u2013 devices and explosives. So I said, for God\u2019s sake, why me? And they said, no well, you were a bomber pilot in the war, you see, so you must know how to make bombs. I said, but for Christ\u2019s sake, Govan, (Mbeki) we didn\u2019t make our own bombs. And they said, but you know about those things and I said, no, bombs were made in bloody factories, I don\u2019t know. So he said, anyway, you\u2019re appointed. We did a good job, actually. Meanwhile, in November 1962, the then-Minister of Justice, John Vorster, banned New Age. When the editorial board came out with its successor publication Spark, Vorster went one step further by banning not the newspaper but its editors and writers. This effectively ended Mbeki's role as editor and journalist in the country. On 11 July 1963, he was arrested with other MK high commanders. In 1964, he was an accused in the Rivonia Trial and sentenced to Robben Island. Books In 1939, Mbeki published his first book, Transkei in the Making. A supporter of the 1950-1961 Pondoland peasant revolt, he wrote the pioneering study of the movement, South Africa: The Peasants' Revolt from 1958, which was published in 1964. Much of the book is an analysis of the political economy of the Transkei, rather than the revolt itself.Following the Rivonia Trial, Mbeki served a long-term on Robben Island, during which he managed to run education classes with prisoners, many on Marxist theory, and wrote a number of significant analyses jail, which were kept on the island and used for discussions. The surviving copies have since been published.In 1992, he published The Struggle For Liberation in South Africa: A Short History and in 1996, Sunset at Midday: Latshonilangemini! Release and post-apartheid role Mbeki was released from custody after serving 24 years in the Robben Island prison on 5 November 1987. He served in South Africa's post-apartheid Senate from 1994 to 1997 as Deputy President of the Senate, and then the Senate's successor, the National Council of Provinces, from 1997 to 1999. Mbeki died in Port Elizabeth on 30 August 2001. He was given state funeral during his son's presidency (Thabo) on 8 September 2001. His remains were the subject of controversy in 2006 when plans were made to exhume them, and place them in a museum. These plans were called off after Mbeki's family refused the request. Awards and honours Mbeki received an honorary doctorate in the Social Sciences from the University of Amsterdam in 1978. His son Moeletsi attended the ceremony, as Mbeki was imprisoned at Robben Island. On 26 June 1980, the Secretary General of the then-illegal African National Congress, Alfred Nzo, announced the conferring of the Isitwalandwe Medal, the ANC's highest honour, on Mbeki. Mbeki was, however, not present to receive the award, because he was serving a life imprisonment sentence on Robben Island. Mbeki received international recognition for his political achievements including the renaming (at Mandela's suggestion) of the recently opened health building at Glasgow Caledonian University. The Govan Mbeki Health Building was inaugurated in 2001 at a ceremony featuring his son Thabo.The Govan Mbeki Local Municipality in Mpumulanga is named in his honour. In 2004 he was voted 97th in the SABC 3's Great South Africans. In 2013 a large section of road between Swartklip and Baden Powell Road, running between the neighborhoods of Browns Farm, Gugulethu, Nyanga and Crossroads in Cape Town was renamed Govan Mbeki Road.

In the early 20th century, he set up a dental practice and was elected president of the village council of Glenwood in neighboring Pope County.  Political career Shipstead started as a Republican but in 1922 was elected to the US Senate under the banner of the new Farmer-Labor Party. While he generally shared the party's left-wing agenda, he rejected the extreme anti-capitalism of some members. Although he was the only Farmer-Laborite in the Senate, he won appointment to the powerful Foreign Relations Committee.Shipstead opposed U.S. entry into the League of Nations and the World Court. He called for the cancellation of German reparations, which he regarded as vindictive. Unlike non-interventionists in the Old Right, he objected to the U.S. occupation of Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. He blamed these interventions on the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine of 1905, which had turned the United States into an arrogant \"policeman of the western continent.\" Isolationism Shipstead did not consider himself an isolationist. While he favored a policy of political non-intervention overseas, he opposed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, which he called \"one of the greatest and most vicious isolationist policies this government has ever enacted.\" He argued that high tariffs \"raise prices to consumers\" and make \"monopolies richer and people poorer.\" Affable and dignified, his adversaries generally liked him personally. He concluded, \"It doesn't necessarily follow that a radical has to be a damned fool.\" Along with Congressman Robert Luce of Massachusetts, he introduced the bill that enlarged the purview of the United States Commission of Fine Arts to include new buildings on private land facing federal property. The commission, established in 1910, reviews new buildings, memorials, monuments, and public art constructed on federal property in Washington, D.C. The bill, the Shipstead-Luce Act, is still in effect. Shipstead defected from the Farmer-Labor party in the late 1930s, charging that Communist elements were taking control. He won reelection to the Senate in 1940 as a Republican. Antisemitism Shipstead was \"a known antisemite.\" He was an outspoken ally of Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh, and he trafficked in anti-Jewish conspiracy theories, as well as straightforward bigotry against Jewish people. Shipstead said he believed that The Protocols of the Elders of Zion were fact, and he frequently encouraged other people to read them. Meanwhile, few fought more tenaciously against Franklin D. Roosevelt's efforts to enter the war in Europe. Although Shipstead voted for the declaration of war after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he still maintained his independence from Roosevelt. In October 1942, for example, he was one of the very few to vote against Selective Service, just as he had in 1940. World War II In April 1943 Isaiah Berlin, a top British expert on American politics, secretly prepared an analysis for the British Foreign Office that stated that Shipstead was: a rabid Isolationist of Norwegian descent, elected largely by the Scandinavian vote. A very narrow, bigoted, crotchety man, intensely antagonistic to Minnesota's Governor Harold Stassen. A member of the Farm Bloc and consistently votes against the Administration. In protest of his views, a group of southern senators including J. Lister Hill, John H. Bankhead II, Tom Stewart, Kenneth McKellar, Richard Russell Jr. and Walter F. George stopped conversing, got up, and left from the Senate's lunch counter when Senator Shipstead attempted to join them, with Hill later telling reporters they \"would not associate\" with the Senator due to his isolationist views. Later, after a private argument with the same six Senators, Shipstead lamented what he called the \"extreme Anglophilia of the southern states.\" Richard Russell Jr. said that Shipstead was \"a chicken\" who was \"in kahoots\" with Germany. Postwar Shipstead's vote against US entry into the United Nations was entirely predictable by anyone who had followed his career. It was the capstone of decades of opposition to foreign entanglements. Like many modern conservative critics of the UN, he feared that it would foster a world superstate. But he also believed that the major powers would use the UN as a tool to dominate smaller countries. He and William Langer were the only two senators to vote against the United Nations Charter. Not surprisingly, Shipstead and Langer were also among the seven senators who opposed full United States entry into the United Nations. These votes may have cost him reelection a year later. A new breed of \"internationalists\", led by Governor Edward John Thye and former Governor Stassen, assumed leadership of the Minnesota state GOP. In 1946, Shipstead lost the Republican primary to Thye. He retired to rural western Minnesota, where he died in 1960.

He is best known for creating The Adventures of Tintin, the series of comic albums which are considered one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, Quick & Flupke (1930\u20131940) and The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko (1936\u20131957). His works were executed in his distinct ligne claire drawing style.\nBorn to a lower-middle-class family in Etterbeek, Brussels, Herg\u00e9 began his career by contributing illustrations to Scouting magazines, developing his first comic series, The Adventures of Totor, for Le Boy-Scout Belge in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, he created The Adventures of Tintin in 1929 on the advice of its editor Norbert Wallez. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, the series' early installments \u2014 Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, Tintin in the Congo, and Tintin in America \u2014 were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Herg\u00e9 continuing the series and also developing both the Quick & Flupke and Jo, Zette and Jocko series for Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle. Influenced by his friend Zhang Chongren, from 1934 Herg\u00e9 placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from The Blue Lotus onward. Following the German occupation of Belgium in 1940, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle was closed, but Herg\u00e9 continued his series in Le Soir, a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.\nAfter the Allied liberation of Belgium in 1944, Le Soir was shut down and its staff \u2014 including Herg\u00e9 \u2014 accused of having been collaborators. An official investigation was launched, and while no charges were brought against Herg\u00e9, in subsequent years he repeatedly faced accusations of having been a traitor and collaborator. With Raymond Leblanc he established Tintin magazine in 1946, through which he serialised new Adventures of Tintin stories. As the magazine's artistic director, he also oversaw the publication of other successful comics series, such as Edgar P. Jacobs' Blake and Mortimer. In 1950 he established Studios Herg\u00e9 as a team to aid him in his ongoing projects; prominent staff members Jacques Martin and Bob de Moor greatly contributed to subsequent volumes of The Adventures of Tintin. Amid personal turmoil following the collapse of his first marriage, he produced Tintin in Tibet, his personal favourite of his works. In later years he became less prolific, and unsuccessfully attempted to establish himself as an abstract artist.\nHerg\u00e9's works have been widely acclaimed for their clarity of draughtsmanship and meticulous, well-researched plots. They have been the source of a wide range of adaptations, in theatre, radio, television, cinema, and computer gaming. He remains a strong influence on the comic book medium, particularly in Europe. He is widely celebrated in Belgium: a Herg\u00e9 Museum was established in Louvain-la-Neuve in 2009.","public_knowledge":"Georges Prosper Remi (French: [\u0281\u0259mi]; 22 May 1907 \u2013 3 March 1983), known by the pen name Herg\u00e9 (; French: [\u025b\u0281\u0292e]), from the French pronunciation of his initials, was a Belgian cartoonist.

He was also responsible for two other well-known series, Quick & Flupke (1930\u20131940) and The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko (1936\u20131957). His works were executed in his distinct ligne claire drawing style.\nBorn to a lower-middle-class family in Etterbeek, Brussels, Herg\u00e9 began his career by contributing illustrations to Scouting magazines, developing his first comic series, The Adventures of Totor, for Le Boy-Scout Belge in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, he created The Adventures of Tintin in 1929 on the advice of its editor Norbert Wallez. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, the series' early installments \u2014 Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, Tintin in the Congo, and Tintin in America \u2014 were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Herg\u00e9 continuing the series and also developing both the Quick & Flupke and Jo, Zette and Jocko series for Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle. Influenced by his friend Zhang Chongren, from 1934 Herg\u00e9 placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from The Blue Lotus onward. Following the German occupation of Belgium in 1940, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle was closed, but Herg\u00e9 continued his series in Le Soir, a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.\nAfter the Allied liberation of Belgium in 1944, Le Soir was shut down and its staff \u2014 including Herg\u00e9 \u2014 accused of having been collaborators. An official investigation was launched, and while no charges were brought against Herg\u00e9, in subsequent years he repeatedly faced accusations of having been a traitor and collaborator. With Raymond Leblanc he established Tintin magazine in 1946, through which he serialised new Adventures of Tintin stories. As the magazine's artistic director, he also oversaw the publication of other successful comics series, such as Edgar P. Jacobs' Blake and Mortimer. In 1950 he established Studios Herg\u00e9 as a team to aid him in his ongoing projects; prominent staff members Jacques Martin and Bob de Moor greatly contributed to subsequent volumes of The Adventures of Tintin. Amid personal turmoil following the collapse of his first marriage, he produced Tintin in Tibet, his personal favourite of his works. In later years he became less prolific, and unsuccessfully attempted to establish himself as an abstract artist.\nHerg\u00e9's works have been widely acclaimed for their clarity of draughtsmanship and meticulous, well-researched plots. They have been the source of a wide range of adaptations, in theatre, radio, television, cinema, and computer gaming. He remains a strong influence on the comic book medium, particularly in Europe. He is widely celebrated in Belgium: a Herg\u00e9 Museum was established in Louvain-la-Neuve in 2009.  Early life Childhood and youth: 1907\u20131925 Georges Prosper Remi was born on 22 May 1907 in his parental home in Etterbeek, Brussels, a central suburb in the capital city of Belgium. His was a lower-middle-class family. His Walloon father, Alexis Remi, worked in a confectionery factory, whilst his Flemish mother, Elisabeth Dufour, was a housewife. Married on 18 January 1905, they moved into a house at 25 rue Cranz (now 33 rue Philippe Baucq), where Georges was born, although a year later they moved to a house at 34 rue de Theux. His primary language was his father's French, but growing up in the bilingual Brussels, he also learned Dutch, developing a Marollien accent from his maternal grandmother. A younger brother, Paul, was born five years after Georges. Like most Belgians, his family belonged to the Roman Catholic Church, though they were not particularly devout. He later characterised his life in Etterbeek as dominated by a monochrome grey, considering it extremely boring. Biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters suggested that this childhood melancholy might have been exacerbated through being sexually abused by a maternal uncle, Charles Arthur Dufour.Remi developed a love of cinema, favouring Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur and the films of Charlie Chaplin, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton; his later work in the comic strip medium displayed an obvious influence from them in style and content. Although not a keen reader, he enjoyed the novels of British and US authors, such as Huckleberry Finn, Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe and The Pickwick Papers, as well as the novels of Frenchman Alexandre Dumas. Drawing as a hobby, he sketched out scenes from daily life along the edges of his school books. Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of primary schooling at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with World War I, during which Brussels was occupied by the German army. In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in Ixelles, but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests. Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 at the top of his class. Aged 12, Remi joined the Boy Scout brigade attached to Saint-Boniface School, becoming troop leader of the Squirrel Patrol and earning the name \"Curious Fox\" (Renard curieux). With the Scouts, he travelled to summer camps in Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Spain, and in the summer of 1923 his troop hiked 200 miles across the Pyrenees. His experiences with Scouting would have a significant influence on the rest of his life, sparking his love of camping and the natural world, and providing him with a moral compass that stressed personal loyalty and keeping one's promises.His Scoutmaster, Rene Weverbergh, encouraged his artistic ability, and published one of Remi's drawings in the newsletter of the Saint-Boniface Scouts, Jamais Assez (Never Enough): his first published work. When Weverbergh became involved in the publication of Boy-Scout, the newsletter of the Federation of Scouts, he published more of Remi's illustrations, the first of which appeared in the fifth issue, from 1922. Remi continued publishing cartoons, drawings and woodcuts in subsequent issues of the newsletter, which was soon renamed Le Boy-Scout Belge (The Belgian Boy Scout). During this time, he experimented with different pseudonyms, using \"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie\" and \"J\u00e9r\u00e9miades\" before settling on \"Herg\u00e9\", the French pronunciation of his reversed initials (R.G.) His work was first published under this name in December 1924. Totor and early career: 1925\u20131928 Alongside his stand-alone illustrations, in July 1926 Herg\u00e9 began production of a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Herg\u00e9 began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech balloons. Illustrations were also published in Le Bl\u00e9 qui l\u00e8ve (The Wheat That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Action for the Belgian Youth (Action catholique de la jeunesse belge), and Herg\u00e9 produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, The Soul of the Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Herg\u00e9 sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.After graduating from secondary school in 1925, Herg\u00e9 enrolled in the \u00c9cole Saint-Luc art school, but finding the teaching boring, he left after one lesson. He hoped for a job as an illustrator alongside Ickx at Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle (The Twentieth Century) \u2014 a conservative \"Catholic Newspaper of Doctrine and Information\" \u2014 but no positions were available. Instead he got a job in the paper's subscriptions department, starting in September 1925. Despising the boredom of this position, he enlisted for military service before he was called up, and in August 1926 was assigned to the Dailly barracks at Schaerbeek. Joining the first infantry regiment, he was also bored by his military training, but continued sketching and producing episodes of Totor.Toward the end of his military service, in August 1927, Herg\u00e9 met the editor of Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, the Abb\u00e9 Norbert Wallez, a vocal fascist who kept a signed photograph of the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini on his desk. Impressed by Herg\u00e9's repertoire, Wallez agreed to give him a job as a photographic reporter and cartoonist for the paper, something for which Herg\u00e9 always remained grateful, coming to view the Abb\u00e9 as a father figure. Supplemented by commissions for other publications, Herg\u00e9 illustrated a number of texts for \"The Children's Corner\" and the literary pages; the illustrations of this period show his interest in woodcuts and the early prototype of his ligne claire style. Founding Tintin and Quick & Flupke: 1929\u20131932 Beginning a series of newspaper supplements in late 1928, Wallez founded a supplement for children, Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me (The Little Twentieth), which subsequently appeared in Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle every Thursday. Carrying strong Catholic and fascist messages, many of its passages were explicitly anti-semitic. For this new venture, Herg\u00e9 illustrated L'Extraordinaire Aventure de Flup, N\u00e9nesse, Poussette et Cochonnet (The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, N\u00e9nesse, Poussette and Cochonnet), a comic strip authored by one of the paper's sport columnists, which told the story of two boys, one of their little sisters, and her inflatable rubber pig. Herg\u00e9 was unsatisfied, and eager to write and draw a comic strip of his own. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium \u2014 such as the systematic use of speech bubbles \u2014 found in such US comics as George McManus' Bringing Up Father, George Herriman's Krazy Kat and Rudolph Dirks's The Katzenjammer Kids, copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper's reporter L\u00e9on Degrelle, stationed there to report on the Cristero War. Herg\u00e9 developed a character named Tintin as a Belgian boy reporter who could travel the world with his fox terrier, Snowy \u2014 \"Milou\" in the original French \u2014 basing him in large part on his earlier character of Totor and also on his own brother, Paul. Degrelle later falsely claimed that Tintin had been based on him, while he and Herg\u00e9 fell out when Degrelle used one of his designs without permission; they settled out-of-court. Although Herg\u00e9 wanted to send his character to the United States, Wallez instead ordered him to set his adventure in the Soviet Union, acting as a work of anti-socialist propaganda for children. The result, Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, began serialisation in Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me on 10 January 1929, and ran until 8 May 1930. Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organized a publicity stunt at the Gare de Nord station, following which he organized the publication of the story in book form. The popularity of the story led to an increase in sales, and so Wallez granted Herg\u00e9 two assistants, Eug\u00e8ne Van Nyverseel and Paul \"Jam\" Jamin.In January 1930, Herg\u00e9 introduced Quick & Flupke (Quick et Flupke), a new comic strip about two street kids from Brussels, in the pages of Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me. At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of the second Tintin adventure, Tintin in the Congo, designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it would be accused of racism; however, at the time it was un-controversial and popular, with further publicity stunts held to increase sales. For the third adventure, Tintin in America, serialised from September 1931 to October 1932, Herg\u00e9 finally got to deal with a scenario of his own choice, although he used the work to push an anti-capitalist, anti-consumerist agenda in keeping with the paper's ultra-conservative ideology. Although the Adventures of Tintin had been serialised in the French Catholic C\u0153urs Vaillants (\"Brave Hearts\") since 1930, he was soon receiving syndication requests from Swiss and Portuguese newspapers too. Though wealthier than most Belgians at his age, and despite increasing success, he remained an unfazed \"conservative young man\" dedicated to his work.Herg\u00e9 sought work elsewhere too, creating The Lovable Mr. Mops cartoon for the Bon March\u00e9 department store, and The Adventures of Tim the Squirrel Out West for the rival L'Innovation department store. First marriage At the offices of Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me in 1928, Herg\u00e9 met the woman who would become his first wife, Germaine Kieckens (1906 \u2013 26 October 1995). A redhead described by Pierre Assouline as \"elegant and popular\", she had obtained work as the secretary for Norbert Wallez. At the time of her birth, her parents were relatively elderly, and having lost an earlier child they were particularly overprotective of her. Greatly admiring Wallez, whom she looked up to as a father figure, she adopted his fascist political beliefs. She was appointed editor of Votre Vingti\u00e8me, Madame, a supplement for women for which Herg\u00e9 sometimes drew the cover. She also began writing articles for Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me using the pseudonym Tantine. The first 500 copies of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets were numbered and signed by Herg\u00e9 using Tintin's signature, with Snowy's paw print being drawn next to it by Kieckens.In 1930, Herg\u00e9 escorted her home from work almost every night, though she expressed little romantic interest in him at the time. Instead she desired an older, or more mature man, such as the Abb\u00e9 himself. Wallez however encouraged the two to enter into a relationship, and one evening at the Taverne du Palace she indicated to Herg\u00e9 that she would be interested in a relationship.On 20 July 1932 Herg\u00e9 and Kieckens were married; although neither of them was entirely happy with the union, they had been encouraged to do so by Wallez, who insisted that all his single staff married and who personally carried out the wedding ceremony at the Saint-Roch Church in Laeken. Spending their honeymoon in Vianden, Luxembourg, the couple moved into an apartment in the rue Knapen, Schaerbeek. Rising fame Tintin in the Orient and Jo, Zette & Jocko: 1932\u20131939 In November 1932 Herg\u00e9 announced that the following month he would send Tintin on an adventure to Asia. Although initially titled The Adventures of Tintin, Reporter, in the Orient, it would later be renamed Cigars of the Pharaoh. A mystery story, the plot began in Egypt before proceeding to Arabia and India, during which the recurring characters of Thomson and Thompson and Rastapopoulos were introduced. Through his friend Charles Lesne, Herg\u00e9 was hired to produce illustrations for the company Casterman, and in late 1933 they proposed taking over the publication of both The Adventures of Tintin and Quick and Flupke in book form, to which Herg\u00e9 agreed; the first Casterman book was the collected volume of Cigars. Continuing to subsidise his comic work with commercial advertising, in January 1934 he also founded the \"Atelier Herg\u00e9\" advertising company with two partners, but it was liquidated after six months.After Wallez was removed from the paper's editorship in August 1933 following a scandal, Herg\u00e9 became despondent; in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 to 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me.From February to August 1934 Herg\u00e9 serialised Popol Out West in Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me, a story using animal characters that was a development of the earlier Tim the Squirrel comic.From August 1934 to October 1935, Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me serialised Tintin's next adventure, The Blue Lotus, which was set in China and dealt with the recent Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Herg\u00e9 had been greatly influenced in the production of the work by his friend Zhang Chongren, a Catholic Chinese student studying at Brussels' Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts, to whom he had been introduced in May 1934. Zhang gave him lessons in Taoist philosophy, Chinese art and Chinese calligraphy, influencing not only his artistic style, but also his general outlook on life. As a token of appreciation Herg\u00e9 added a fictional \"Chang Chong-Chen\" to The Blue Lotus, a young Chinese boy who meets and befriends Tintin. For The Blue Lotus, Herg\u00e9 devoted far more attention to accuracy, resulting in a largely realistic portrayal of China. As a result, The Blue Lotus has been widely hailed as \"Herg\u00e9's first masterpiece\" and a benchmark in the series' development. Casterman published it in book form, also insisting that Herg\u00e9 include colour plates in both the volume and in reprints of America and Cigars. In 1936, they also began production of Tintin merchandise, something Herg\u00e9 supported, having ideas of an entire shop devoted to The Adventures of Tintin, something that would come to fruition 50 years later. Nevertheless, while his serialised comics proved lucrative, the collected volumes sold less well, something Herg\u00e9 blamed on Casterman, urging them to do more to market his books. Herg\u00e9's next Tintin story, The Broken Ear (1935\u20131937), was the first for which the plot synopsis had been outlined from the start, being a detective story that took Tintin to South America. It introduced the character of General Alcazar, and also saw Herg\u00e9 introduce the first fictional countries into the series, San Theodoros and Nuevo Rico, two republics based largely on Bolivia and Paraguay. The violent elements within The Broken Ear upset the publishers of C\u0153urs Vaillants, who asked Herg\u00e9 to create a more child-appropriate story for them. The result was The Adventures of Jo, Zette, and Jocko, a series about a young brother and sister and their pet monkey. The series began with The Secret Ray, which was serialised in C\u0153urs Vaillants and then Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me, and continued with The Stratoship H-22. Herg\u00e9 nevertheless disliked the series, commenting that the characters \"bored me terribly.\" Now writing three series simultaneously, Herg\u00e9 was working every day of the year, and felt stressed.The next Tintin adventure was The Black Island (1937\u20131938), which saw the character travel to Britain to battle counterfeiters and introduced a new antagonist, the German Dr. M\u00fcller. Herg\u00e9 followed this with King Ottokar's Sceptre (1938\u20131939), in which Tintin saves the fictional Eastern European country of Syldavia from being invaded by its expansionist neighbour, Borduria; the event was an anti-fascist satire of Nazi Germany's expansion into Austria and Czechoslovakia. In May 1939, Herg\u00e9 moved to a new house in Watermael-Boitsfort, although following the German invasion of Poland, he was conscripted into the Belgian army and temporarily stationed in Herenthout. Demobbed within the month, he returned to Brussels and adopted a more explicit anti-German stance when beginning his next Tintin adventure, Land of Black Gold, which was set in the Middle East and featured Dr. M\u00fcller sabotaging oil lines.During this period, Herg\u00e9 also contributed to L'Ouest (The West), a newspaper run by his friend Raymond De Becker. L'Ouest urged Belgium to remain neutral in World War II, a stance Herg\u00e9 supported, creating the Mr Bellum strip to argue this position. Herg\u00e9 was invited to visit China by Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, who had enjoyed The Blue Lotus, although due to the political situation in Europe, this was not possible. He was re-mobilized in December, and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me. However, he fell ill with sinusitis and boils and was declared unfit for military service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle was shut down, part way through the serialisation of Land of Black Gold. German occupation and Le Soir: 1939\u20131945 As the Belgian Army clashed with the invading Germans, Herg\u00e9 and his wife fled by car to France along with tens of thousands of other Belgians, first staying in Paris and then heading south to Puy-de-D\u00f4me, where they remained for six weeks. On 28 May, King Leopold III of the Belgians surrendered the country to the German army to prevent further killing; a move that Herg\u00e9 supported. He followed the king's request that all of those Belgians who had fled the country return, arriving back in Brussels on 30 June. There, he found that his house had been occupied as an office for the German army's Propagandastaffel, and also faced financial trouble, as he owed back taxes yet was unable to access his financial reserves. All Belgian publications were now under the control of the German occupying force, who refused Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me permission to continue publication. Instead, Herg\u00e9 was offered employment as a cartoonist for Le Pays R\u00e9el by its editor, the Rexist Victor Matthys, but Herg\u00e9 perceived Le Pays R\u00e9el as an explicitly political publication, and thus declined the position.Instead, he took up a position with Le Soir, Belgium's largest Francophone daily newspaper. Confiscated from its original owners, the German authorities had permitted Le Soir to be re-opened under the directorship of De Doncker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism. After joining the Le Soir team on 15 October, Herg\u00e9 was involved in the creation of a children's supplement, Soir-Jeunesse, aided by Jamin and Jacques Van Melkebeke. He relaunched The Adventures of Tintin with a new story, The Crab with the Golden Claws, in which Tintin pursued drug smugglers in North Africa; the story was a turning point in the series for its introduction of Captain Haddock, who would become a major character in the rest of the Adventures. This story, like the subsequent Adventures of Tintin published in Le Soir, would reject the political themes present in earlier stories, instead remaining firmly neutral. Herg\u00e9 also included new Quick & Flupke gags in the supplement, as well as illustrations for serialised stories by Edgar Allan Poe and the Brothers Grimm.In May 1941, a paper shortage led to the Soir-Jeunesse being reduced to four pages, with the length of the Tintin strip being cut by two thirds. Several weeks later the supplement disappeared altogether, with The Crab with the Golden Claws being moved into Le Soir itself, where it became a daily strip. While some Belgians were upset that Herg\u00e9 was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration, he was heavily enticed by the size of Le Soir's readership, which reached 600,000. With Van Melkebeke, Herg\u00e9 put together two Tintin plays. The first, Tintin in the Indies, appeared at Brussels' Theatre des Galeries in April 1941, while the second, Mr Boullock's Disappearance, was performed there in December. From October 1941 to May 1942, Le Soir serialised Herg\u00e9's next Tintin adventure, The Shooting Star, followed by publication as a single volume by Casterman. In keeping with Le Soir's editorial standpoint, The Shooting Star espoused an anti-Semitic and anti-American attitude, with the antagonist being a wealthy Jewish American businessman; it would thus prove particularly controversial in the post-war period, although Herg\u00e9 denied any malicious anti-Semitic intention. Casterman felt that the black-and-white volumes of The Adventures of Tintin were not selling as well as colour comic books, and thus that the series should be produced in colour. At the same time, Belgium was facing a paper-shortage, with Casterman wishing to cut down the volumes from 120-pages in length to 62. Herg\u00e9 was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to their demands in February 1942. For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Herg\u00e9 insisted that colour should remain secondary to line, and that it would not be used for shading. To cope with this additional workload, Herg\u00e9 approached a friend whom he had met through Van Melkebeke, Edgar P. Jacobs, to aid him as a cartoonist and colourist. Jacobs could only work on the project part-time, and so in March 1942, Herg\u00e9 also employed a woman named Alice Devos to aid him. In July 1942, Herg\u00e9 then procured an agent, Bernard Thi\u00e8ry, who took 40% of his commissions; their working relationship would be strained. With their assistance, from 1942 to 1947, Herg\u00e9 adapted most of his previous Adventures of Tintin into 62-page colour versions.Herg\u00e9's next Adventure of Tintin would be The Secret of the Unicorn, serialised in Le Soir from June 1942. He had collaborated closely with Van Melkebeke on this project, who had introduced many elements from the work of Jules Verne into the detective story, in which Tintin and Haddock searched for parchments revealing the location of hidden pirate treasure. The Secret of the Unicorn marked the first half of a story arc that was completed in Red Rackham's Treasure, serialised in Le Soir from February 1943; in this story, Tintin and Haddock search for the pirate's treasure in the Caribbean, with the character of Professor Calculus being introduced to the series. Following Red Rackham's Treasure, Herg\u00e9 drew illustrations for a serialised story titled Dupont et Dupond, d\u00e9tectives (\"Thomson and Thompson, Detectives\"), authored by the newspaper's crime editor, Paul Kinnet.In September 1943, De Becker was removed as editor of Le Soir for stating that although the Nazis were motivated \"by undoubted good will, [they were also] extremely out of touch with reality\". Although Herg\u00e9 was close to De Becker, he decided to remain at the newspaper, which came under the editorship of Max Hodeige. In autumn 1943, Herg\u00e9 had decided that he wanted Jacobs to collaborate with him on The Adventures of Tintin. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. Jacobs and Herg\u00e9 became close collaborators and greatly influenced each other, while together they developed the plot for the next Adventure of Tintin, The Seven Crystal Balls, which began serialisation in Le Soir in December 1943. Post-war controversy: 1944\u20131946 As the Allied troops liberated Brussels from German occupation, Le Soir ceased publication on 2 September 1944, partway through its serialisation of The Seven Crystal Balls. Herg\u00e9 was arrested on 3 September, having been named as a collaborator in a Resistance document known as the \"Gallery of Traitors\". This would be the first of four incidents in which Herg\u00e9 was arrested \u2014 by the State Security, the Judiciary Police, the Belgian National Movement, and the Front for Independence respectively \u2014 during the course of which he spent one night in jail. On 5 September the entire staff of Le Soir were fired and a new editorial team introduced, while on 8 September the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) issued a proclamation announcing that \"any journalist who had helped produce a newspaper during the occupation was for the time being barred from practising his profession.\" Blacklisted, Herg\u00e9 was now unemployed. Further, he was publicly lampooned as a collaborator by a newspaper closely associated with the Belgian Resistance, La Patrie, which issued a satirical strip titled The Adventures of Tintin in the Land of the Nazis.The period witnessed widespread recriminations against accused collaborators, with military courts condemning 30,000 on minor charges and 25,000 on more serious charges; of those, 5,500 were sentenced to life imprisonment or capital punishment. A judiciary inquiry into Herg\u00e9's case was launched by the deputy public prosecutor, Mr Vin\u00e7otte, although in his report he urged lenience, stating that \"I am inclined to close the case. I believe it would bring ridicule on the judicial system to go after an inoffensive children's book author and illustrator. On the other hand, Herg\u00e9 worked for Le Soir during the war, and his illustrations are what made people buy the newspaper.\" Although unable to work for the press, Herg\u00e9 continued to re-draw and colour the older Adventures of Tintin for publication in book form by Casterman, completing the second version of Tintin in the Congo and starting on King Ottokar's Sceptre. Casterman supported Herg\u00e9 throughout his ordeal, for which he always remained grateful. Attempting to circumvent his blacklisting, with Jacobs he began producing comics under the anonymous pseudonym of \"Olav\", but upon sending them to publishers found none who would accept them. Although this period allowed him an escape from the pressure of daily production which had affected most of his working life, he also had to deal with family problems: His brother Paul returned to Brussels from a German prisoner-of-war camp, although their mother had become highly delusional and was moved to a psychiatric hospital. In October 1945, Herg\u00e9 was approached by Raymond Leblanc, a former member of a conservative Resistance group, the National Royalist Movement, and his associates Andr\u00e9 Sinave and Albert Debaty. The trio were planning on launching a weekly magazine for children, and Leblanc \u2014 who had fond childhood memories of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets \u2014 thought Herg\u00e9 would be ideal for it. Herg\u00e9 agreed, and Leblanc obtained clearance papers for him, allowing him to work. Concerned about the judicial investigation into Herg\u00e9's wartime affiliations, Leblanc convinced William Ugeux, a leader of the Belgian Resistance who was now in charge of censorship and certificates of good citizenship, to look into the comic creator's file. Ugeux concluded that Herg\u00e9 had been \"a blunderer rather than a traitor\" for his work at Le Soir. The decision as to whether Herg\u00e9 would stand trial belonged to the general auditor of the Military Tribunal, Walter Jean Ganshof van der Meersch. He closed the case on 22 December 1945, declaring that \"in regard to the particularly inoffensive character of the drawings published by Remi, bringing him before a war tribunal would be inappropriate and risky\".Now free from threat of prosecution, Herg\u00e9 continued to support his colleagues at Le Soir who were being charged as collaborators; six of them were sentenced to death, and others to lengthy prison sentences. Among those sentenced to death was Herg\u00e9's friend, Jamin, although his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. In May 1946, Herg\u00e9 was issued a certificate of good citizenship, which became largely necessary to obtain employment in post-war Belgium. Celebrations were marred by his mother's death in April 1946; she was aged 60. Harry Thompson has described this post-war period as the \"greatest upheaval\" of Herg\u00e9's life. Herg\u00e9 later described it as \"an experience of absolute intolerance. It was horrible, horrible!\" He considered the post-war trials of alleged collaborators a great injustice inflicted upon many innocent people, and never forgave Belgian society for the way that he had been treated, although he hid this from his public persona. Later life Establishing Tintin magazine: 1946\u20131949 Sinave devised the idea of naming their new magazine Tintin, believing that this would attract a wide audience. The Dutch-language edition produced for release in Belgium's Flemish north was titled Kuifje after the character's Dutch-language name. Adopting the slogan of \"The Newspaper for the Young Aged 7 to 77\", the magazine also used a logo featuring the Tintin character himself. The capital for the project had been put up by those involved: as executive director, Leblanc provided 50%, while its managing director Georges Lallemand provided 40% and Herg\u00e9, its artistic director, provided 10%. Herg\u00e9 assembled a group of associates to aid him, including Van Melkebeke, Jacobs, Paul Cuvelier, and Jacques Laudy. Van Melkebeke was initially appointed editor-in-chief, although he was arrested for having worked for the collaborationist Le Nouveau journal shortly after, with his involvement in the project thus being kept secret so as to avoid further controversy. Van Melkebeke continued to provide work for the magazine under pseudonyms, although this ceased during his imprisonment from December 1947 to October 1949.The first issue of Tintin magazine was published on 26 September 1946. Herg\u00e9 was assigned to produce a two-page spread each week, and began by concluding The Seven Crystal Balls before embarking on its successor story, Prisoners of the Sun. Alongside Herg\u00e9's Adventures of Tintin, the magazine also included Laudy's The Legend of the Four Aymon Brothers and Jacobs' The Secret of the Swordfish, the first in his new Blake and Mortimer series. While the magazine was in competition with a number of rivals, most notably Spirou, famous for serialising the Lucky Luke and Buck Danny comics, it proved an immediate success, with 60,000 copies being sold in three days of its release. Its publication resulted in a massive boost to Herg\u00e9's book sales too.In 1947 a Belgian film adaptation of The Crab with the Golden Claws was produced, and believing that cinematic adaptations were a good way to proceed, Herg\u00e9 contacted Disney Studios in the United States; they declined his offer to adapt The Adventures of Tintin for the silver screen. In May 1947 the artistic collaboration between Herg\u00e9 and Jacobs ended after an argument. Herg\u00e9 had been jealous of the immediate success of Jacobs' Blake and Mortimer series, and had turned down Jacobs' request that he be credited as co-creator of the new Adventures of Tintin. That same month, Herg\u00e9 broke from his manager, Thiery, after discovering that the latter had been siphoning off money for himself.Many Belgians were highly critical of the magazine due to its connections with Herg\u00e9, who was still deemed a collaborator and traitor by many; La Soir and La Cit\u00e9 publicly criticised the decision without referring to him by name while Le Quotidien and Le Drapeau Rouge specifically singled him out for denunciation. Herg\u00e9 believed that the children's author Jeanne Cappe was behind many of these accusations, and threatened her with a lawsuit. Unhappy with life in Belgium, Herg\u00e9 made plans to emigrate to Argentina, a nation that was welcoming many Europeans who had supported the defeated Axis powers and which had a thriving comic book scene. Ultimately, he changed his mind, for reasons that have remained unknown; it is possible that he was unable to secure any promise of work in the South American country. In May, Herg\u00e9 and Germaine holidayed near to Gland on Lake Geneva, Switzerland, where they were accompanied by a friend of theirs, a young woman named Rosane. During the holiday, Herg\u00e9 and Rosane embarked on an extra-marital affair. He felt guilty, and returned to Brussels in June. Privately, he expressed the view that he had been led to commit such an act, which he viewed as immoral, through the influence of \"amoral friends\" with whom he was associating. Hoping to reignite the passion and stability of his marriage, he arranged for him and Germaine to return to Switzerland soon after; here they argued, and embarked on a temporary separation. Remaining in Switzerland, he visited King Leopold III, who was then holidaying in Pr\u00e9gny, before briefly returning to Brussels in July. Back in Switzerland, he embarked on an affair with a married woman, although again informed Germaine before setting off to spend time in the Ardennes. In August, the couple sought to reunite by holidaying together in Brittany, but there they broke up again and Herg\u00e9 returned to his lover in Switzerland. In September he finally returned to Brussels, but with his close friend Marcel Dehaye then spent time in a retreat at the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de-Scourmont. That month, he revived Land of Black Gold \u2014 the Adventure of Tintin that had been interrupted by the German invasion of 1940 \u2014 and began serialising it in Tintin magazine. However, the story was again interrupted, this time for twelve weeks as Herg\u00e9 took a further unannounced holiday to Gland, greatly annoying many of his colleagues.Although they retained respect for each other, Herg\u00e9's repeated absences had created a tense situation between himself and Leblanc. After a lengthy search, Leblanc had found a publisher willing to produce an edition of Tintin magazine in France: Georges Dargaud's Le Lombard, which began production of a French edition in October 1948. However, Herg\u00e9 was unhappy that Leblanc had appointed Andr\u00e9 Frenez as Van Melkebeke's replacement as editor-in-chief, describing Frenez as \"a cold functionary\". Herg\u00e9 was stubborn and uncompromising as the magazine's artistic director, known for strongly criticising the work of old friends like Pierre Ickx if he felt that they did not meet his exacting standards. He was particularly critical of the work of two of the newly hired staff at Tintin and Kuifje, Jacques Martin and Willy Vandersteen, encouraging them to change their artistic style to better reflect his own preferences. To Leblanc, he expressed the concern that most of those working at Tintin were better illustrators than storytellers. He also opined that Tintin was not keeping up with the times and what he perceived as the increased maturity of children, encouraging the magazine to better reflect current events and scientific developments. Studios Herg\u00e9 and Fanny Vlamynck: 1950\u20131965 On 6 April 1950 Herg\u00e9 established Studios Herg\u00e9 as a public company. The Studios were based in his Avenue Delleur house in Brussels, with Herg\u00e9 making a newly purchased country house in C\u00e9roux-Mousty his and Germaine's main residence. The Studios would provide both personal support to Herg\u00e9 and technical support for his ongoing work. Initially with only three employees, this would rise to fifteen, with all working on Herg\u00e9's projects. He hired Bob de Moor as his primary apprentice at the Studios in March 1951. Impressed by Jacques Martin's work on The Golden Sphinx, Herg\u00e9 persuaded Martin to join the Studios in January 1954; Martin insisted on bringing with him his own two assistants, Roger Leloup and Michel Demarets. During the early 1950s, a number of those convicted for collaborating with the Nazi occupiers were freed from prison. Sympathetic to their plight, Herg\u00e9 lent money to some and aided others in getting jobs at Tintin magazine, much to Leblanc's annoyance. For instance, as well as lending him money, Herg\u00e9 used his connections to secure Raymond de Becker a job in Switzerland as a book shop sales inspector. He also hired those associated with collaboration for his Studios; his new colourist, Josette Baujot, was the wife of a recently assassinated member of the Walloon Legion, and his new secretary, Baudouin van der Branden de Reeth, had served a prison sentence for working at Le Nouveau Journal during the occupation.Herg\u00e9 had developed the idea of setting an Adventure of Tintin on the moon while producing Prisoners of the Sun. He began serialisation of Destination Moon, the first of a two part arc followed by Explorers on the Moon, in Tintin magazine in March 1950. In September 1950, Herg\u00e9 broke off the story, feeling the need for a break from work, having fallen back into clinical depression. He and Germaine went on holiday to Gland before returning to Brussels in late September. Many readers sent letters to Tintin asking why Explorers on the Moon was no longer being serialised, with a rumour emerging that Herg\u00e9 had died. Explorers of the Moon would resume after an eighteen-month hiatus, returning in April 1952. Alongside his work on the new stories, Herg\u00e9 also made use of the Studios in revising more of his early works.In February 1952, Herg\u00e9 was involved in a car crash in which Germaine's leg was shattered; she had to have a steel rod implanted in it, and was confined to a wheelchair for several months. Their relationship was further strained when they received news of Wallez' death in September 1952. His friendship with Van Melkebeke also broke apart in this period, in part due to advice gained from an alleged clairvoyant, Bertje Janueneau, upon whom both Herg\u00e9 and Germaine were increasingly relying for guidance. In January 1955 a young woman named Fanny Vlamynck (fr) was hired as a colourist at the Studios. Herg\u00e9 embarked on an extramarital affair with her in November 1956, with the rest of the studio staff soon finding out. Germaine grew suspicious of her husband's affections for Fanny, but was also experiencing a strong romantic attraction to her ballroom dance partner. Herg\u00e9 and Germaine went on a cruise for the former's fiftieth birthday in May 1957, in which they visited Casablanca, Rabat, Palermo, and Rome, and in October went on a second holiday, this time to Ostend. Following this, he revealed his affair with Fanny to Germaine. He began experiencing traumatic dreams dominated by the colour white, and seeking to explain them he visited Franz Ricklin, a psychoanalyst who was a student of Carl Jung in Z\u00fcrich in May 1959. In February 1960 he returned to Switzerland, and upon his arrival back in Brussels he began renting an apartment in Uccle, away from Germaine. His relationship with Germaine had ended, although due to restrictions under Belgian law he was unable to obtain a divorce until seventeen years later. In September 1958, Tintin magazine moved its headquarters to a newly constructed building near the Gare du Midi. Herg\u00e9 continued to feud with Leblanc over the direction of the magazine; his constant absences had led to him being replaced as artistic director, and he demanded that he be reinstated. Leblanc relented in early 1965, although Herg\u00e9 soon departed to Sardinia for six weeks. In October 1965 Leblanc appointed the cartoonist Greg to be editor-in-chief of the magazine, believing him capable of reforming the paper to remain relevant to the youth of the day. By this point, Tintin magazine was at its commercial peak, with sales of 600,000 a week, although Herg\u00e9 had lost much of his interest in it.Herg\u00e9's book sales were higher than ever, and translations were being produced for the British, Spanish, and Scandinavian markets. He was receiving international press attention, with articles on his work appearing in France-Observateur, The Listener, and The Times Literary Supplement. Paul Vandromme authored an uncritical book on Herg\u00e9, Le Monde de Tintin (\"The World of Tintin\"), published by \u00c9ditions Gallimard; Herg\u00e9 vetoed the inclusion of a proposed preface by Roger Nimier after finding its praise for his own work too embarrassing. Radio adaptations of The Adventures of Tintin were produced, as was an animated cartoon series produced by Belvision Studios, Herg\u00e9's Adventures of Tintin. Two live-action films were also produced, Tintin and the Golden Fleece (1961) and Tintin and the Blue Oranges (1964), the former of which Herg\u00e9 had been closely involved with.Developing an interest in modern art, in the early 1960s Herg\u00e9 befriended the art dealer Marcel Stal, owner of the Carrefour gallery in Brussels. He was a particular fan of the work of Constant Permeke, Jakob Smits, Lucio Fontana, and Jean-Pierre Raynaurd, as well as the pop art movement, in particular the work of Roy Lichtenstein. He built up his own personal collection, which consisted of both modern paintings as well as African art and Chinese ceramics. In 1962, Herg\u00e9 decided he wanted to paint. He chose Louis Van Lint, one of the most respected Belgian abstract painters at the time, whose work he liked a lot, to be his private teacher. Herg\u00e9 took up painting as a hobby, producing abstract art works which were influenced by the styles of Joan Mir\u00f3 and Serge Poliakoff. He showed his work to the art historian L\u00e9o Van Puyvelde, who was the chief conservator of the Mus\u00e9es des Beaux-Arts, who believed that they showed promise, but that Herg\u00e9's real talent lay with cartooning. Herg\u00e9 abandoned painting shortly after, having produced 37 paintings in all. Spending less time on new Adventures of Tintin, from June to December 1965 Tintin magazine serialised a redrawn and newly coloured version of The Black Island prepared by staff at Studios Herg\u00e9. Supported by his studio, Herg\u00e9 produced The Calculus Affair between 1954 until 1956 which was followed by The Red Sea Sharks in 1956 to 1957. Final years: 1966\u20131983 In the 1960s, Herg\u00e9 became increasingly annoyed at the success of Ren\u00e9 Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's Asterix comic book series, which various commentators had described as eclipsing The Adventures of Tintin as the foremost comic in the Franco-Belgian tradition. Hoping to imitate the success of the recent animated films Asterix the Gaul (1967) and Asterix and Cleopatra (1968), Herg\u00e9 agreed to the production of two animated Belvision films based on the Adventures of Tintin. The first, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (1969), was based on pre-existing comics, whereas the second, Tintin and the Lake of Sharks (1972) was an original story written by Greg. In 1982, the US filmmaker Steven Spielberg requested the film rights for a live-action adaptation of one of The Adventures of Tintin, a prospect that excited Herg\u00e9, but the project never came to fruition at the time.In October 1971, the journalist Numa Sadoul conducted a wide-ranging interview with Herg\u00e9, in which the latter opened up about many of the problems he had experienced in his personal life. Sadoul planned to publish the interview as a book, but Herg\u00e9 made many alterations to the transcript, both to improve its prose and to remove sections which cast him in a negative light. Editors at Casterman then removed even further sections, particularly those in which Herg\u00e9 expressed a negative view of Catholicism. The interview was published as Tintin et moi (\"Tintin and Me\") in 1975. Herg\u00e9 followed this by agreeing to be the subject of a documentary film produced by Henri Roane, Moi, Tintin (\"I, Tintin\"), which premiered in 1975. In January 1977 he attended an early comic book convention at Angoul\u00eame, where he was widely heralded as one of the masters of the discipline. To mark the fiftieth anniversary of The Adventures of Tintin in 1979, a celebratory event was held at Brussels' Hilton hotel, while an exhibit on \"Le Mus\u00e9e imaginaire de Tintin\" (\"The Imaginary Museum of Tintin\") was held at the Palais de Beaux-Arts.In April 1971 Herg\u00e9 visited the U.S. for the first time, primarily to visit a liver specialist in Rochester, Minnesota; however, on the trip he also visited a Sioux reservation in South Dakota, but was shocked at the conditions in which their inhabitants lived. On this visit he also spent time in Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Kansas City. In April 1972 he travelled to New York City for an international conference on the strip cartoon, and there presented Mayor John Lindsay with a cartoon of Tintin visiting the city and also met with the pop artist Andy Warhol. Several years later, in 1977, Warhol visited Europe, where he produced a pop art portrait of Herg\u00e9. In April 1973, Herg\u00e9 took up an invite to visit Taiwan by the nation's government, in recognition of his promotion of Chinese culture in The Blue Lotus. During the visit he also spent time in Thailand and Bali.Herg\u00e9 had long sought to regain contact with his old friend Zhang Chongren, with whom he had lost contact. He regularly asked any Chinese people that he met if they knew of Zhang, and in 1979 had some success when a staff member in a Brussels Chinese restaurant revealed that he was Zhang's godson. Herg\u00e9 was thus able to re-establish contact with his old friend. The journalist G\u00e9rard Valet organised for Zhang to visit Brussels so that he and Herg\u00e9 could be re-united. The event took place in March 1981, and was heavily publicised; Herg\u00e9 however found the situation difficult, disliking the press attention and finding that he and Zhang had grown distant during the intervening years.In June 1970, Herg\u00e9's father died, and after the funeral he holidayed near Lake Geneva. In 1974, his assistant Branden suffered a stroke and was left unable to write, with Herg\u00e9 replacing him with a young man, Alain Baran, who Herg\u00e9 biographer Pierre Assouline later termed Herg\u00e9's \"surrogate son\". In March 1977, Herg\u00e9's divorce with Germaine was finalised; although Herg\u00e9 continued to visit her and financially support her, Germaine took the divorce badly, viewing it as a further betrayal. Herg\u00e9 was then able to marry Fanny several weeks later, in a low-key ceremony on 20 May; he was 70 years old and she was 42. Death In 1979, Herg\u00e9 was diagnosed with osteomyelofibrosis, necessitating a complete blood transfusion. His need for blood transfusions had increased, as he came to require them every two weeks, and then every week.On 25 February 1983, Herg\u00e9 suffered cardiac arrest and was hospitalised in intensive care at Brussels' Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc. He had been scheduled to meet with Steven Spielberg, who later made The Adventures of Tintin (2011). He died at Saint-Luc on 3 March. His death received front page coverage in numerous francophone newspapers, including Lib\u00e9ration and Le Monde. In his will, he had left Fanny as his sole heir.In November 1986, Fanny closed Studios Herg\u00e9, replacing it with the Herg\u00e9 Foundation.In 1988, Tintin magazine itself was discontinued. Bibliography Only the works marked * have been translated into English Personal life Herg\u00e9 was a highly private person, being described by biographer Harry Thompson as \"reserved [and] unostentatious\". According to his biographer Pierre Sterckx, Herg\u00e9 appeared \"very conventional\" in public, but in reality was \"extremely erudite, with an insatiable curiosity, constantly on the watch\". He greatly enjoyed walking in the countryside, gardening, and art collecting, and he was a fan of jazz music. Although he disliked making public or press appearances, Herg\u00e9 insisted on personally responding to all fan mail received, which took up a considerable part of his time. He stated that \"not replying to children's letters would be to betray their dreams.\" Friends described him as a humorous man, known particularly for his self-deprecating jokes. Colleagues described Herg\u00e9 as egocentric, an assessment he agreed with. He was known to be authoritarian in dealing with his assistants and refused to share credit with them for their part in his work. Sterckx noted that \"on the one hand he could be distant, even frosty, but on the other he was affectionate\".Throughout his first marriage he had a number of affairs with other women. He had no children, having been rendered sterile by radiation treatment, but in the 1950s offered to adopt his brother Paul's two children, Denise and George, when their parents were experiencing trouble in their relationship. Paul declined the offer, with Denise and George later noting that they had no great affection for their uncle, deeming him awkward around children. Herg\u00e9 was raised as a Catholic, although he was never a devout practitioner of the religion. His adherence to Catholicism declined in later life as he developed a keen interest in Taoism, and became an agnostic. He was a fan of the Tao Te Ching and Arnaud Desjardins' The Path to Wisdom, as well as Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics and the work of Jean-\u00c9mile Charon. Political views Politically, Herg\u00e9 was a fervent royalist, and remained so throughout his life, also believing in the unity of Belgium. In his early life, Herg\u00e9 was \"close to the traditional right-wing\" of Belgian society, with Sterckx noting that through his work he was \"plunged into rightist, even extreme right-wing circles\". According to Harry Thompson, such political ideas were not unusual in middle-class circles in Belgium of the 1920s and early 1930s, where \"patriotism, Catholicism, strict morality, discipline and naivety were so inextricably bound together in everyone's lives that right-wing politics were an almost inevitable by-product. It was a world view shared by everyone, distinguished principally by its complete ignorance of the world.\" When Herg\u00e9 took responsibility for Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me, he followed Wallez's instruction and allowed the newspaper to contain explicitly pro-fascist and anti-semitic sentiment. Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s noted that the character of Tintin was a personification of the \"New Youth\" concept which was promoted by the European far-right. Under Wallez's guidance, the early Adventures of Tintin contained explicit political messages for its young readership. Tintin in the Land of the Soviets was a work of anti-socialist propaganda, while Tintin in the Congo was designed to encourage colonialist sentiment toward the Belgian Congo, and Tintin in America was designed as a work of anti-Americanism heavily critical of capitalism, commercialism, and industrialisation.In contrast to Herg\u00e9's involvement in Belgium's right-wing, Sterckx thought the cartoonist to have been \"a liberal and independent spirit\", someone who was \"the very opposite of a conservative [or] a reactionary of the right\". Michael Farr asserted that Herg\u00e9 had \"an acute political conscience\" during his earlier days, as exemplified by his condemnation of racism in the United States evident in Tintin in America. Literary critic Tom McCarthy went further, remarking that Tintin in America represented the emergence of a \"left-wing counter tendency\" in Herg\u00e9's work that rebelled against his right-wing milieu and which was particularly critical of wealthy capitalists and industrialists. This was furthered in The Blue Lotus, in which Herg\u00e9 rejected his \"classically right-wing\" ideas to embrace an anti-imperialist stance, and in a contemporary Quick & Flupke strip in which he lampooned the far-right leaders of Germany and Italy, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Although many of his friends and colleagues did so in the mid-1930s, Herg\u00e9 did not join the far-right Rexist Party, later asserting that he \"had always had an aversion to it\" and commenting that \"to throw my heart and soul into an ideology is the opposite of who I am.\" Accusations of racism Herg\u00e9 faced repeated accusations of racism due to his portrayal of diverse ethnic groups throughout The Adventures of Tintin. According to McCarthy, in Tintin in the Congo Herg\u00e9 represented the Congolese as \"good at heart, but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery\". Thompson argued that Herg\u00e9 had not written the book to be \"deliberately racist\" and that it reflected the average early 20th-century Belgian view of the Congolese, which was more patronising than malevolent. The book provoked no controversy at the time, coming to be perceived as racist only in the latter half of the 20th century.In the following adventure, Tintin in America, Herg\u00e9 depicted members of the Blackfoot tribe of Native Americans as \"gullible, even naive\", though it was nevertheless \"broadly sympathetic\" to their culture and plight, depicting their oppression at the hands of the United States Army. The Blue Lotus received both criticism for depicting the Japanese as militaristic and buck-toothed and praise for representing a less stereotypical vision of China than was the norm in Europe at the time.Herg\u00e9 has also been accused of utilising anti-semitic stereotypes, despite Herg\u00e9's protestations that the character of Rastapopoulos was Greek, and not Jewish.From his early years, Herg\u00e9 was openly critical of racism. He lambasted the pervasive racism of U.S. society in a prelude comment to Tintin in America published in Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me on 20 August 1931, and ridiculed racist attitudes toward the Chinese in The Blue Lotus. Peeters asserted that \"Herg\u00e9 was no more racist than the next man\", an assessment shared by Farr, who after meeting Herg\u00e9 in the 1980s commented that \"you couldn't have met someone who was more open and less racist\". In contrast, President of the International Bande Dessin\u00e9e Society Laurence Grove opined that Herg\u00e9 adhered to prevailing societal trends in his work, and that \"When it was fashionable to be a Nazi, he was a Nazi. When it was fashionable to be a colonial racist, that's what he was.\" Vietnamese-American novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen wrote in 2022, after discussing Tintin's racist elements, that \"Herg\u00e9\u2019s work is deeply flawed, and yet riveting narratively and aesthetically. I have forgotten all the well-intentioned, moralistic children\u2019s literature that I have read, but I haven\u2019t forgotten Herg\u00e9.\" Legacy Assouline described Herg\u00e9 as \"the personification of Belgium\". Awards and recognition 1971: Adamson Awards, Sweden 1972: Yellow Kid lifetime award (\"una vita per il cartooning\") at the Festival of Lucca 1973: Grand Prix Saint Michel of the city of Brussels 1999: Included in the Harvey Award Jack Kirby Hall of Fame 2003: Included in the Eisner Award Hall of Fame as the Judge's choice 2006: The Dalai Lama bestowed the International Campaign for Tibet's Light of Truth Award upon the character of Tintin. 2007: Selected as the main motif for a Belgian commemorative coin with a face value of \u20ac20 in honour of his 100th birthday.According to the UNESCO's Index Translationum, Herg\u00e9 is the ninth-most-often-translated French-language author, the second-most-often-translated Belgian author after Georges Simenon, and the second-most-often-translated French-language comics author behind Ren\u00e9 Goscinny. He also had an asteroid, 1652 Herg\u00e9, within the main belt, named after him in 1953. In popular culture A cartoon version of Herg\u00e9 makes a number of cameo appearances in the 1990s animated television series The Adventures of Tintin. An animated version of Herg\u00e9 also makes a cameo appearance at the start of the 2011 motion capture film, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson, where he is depicted as a street cartoonist drawing a portrait of Tintin in the style of the comic at the start of the film. Herg\u00e9 Museum The Mus\u00e9e Herg\u00e9 is located in the centre of Louvain-la-Neuve, a city to the south of Brussels. This location was originally chosen for the Museum in 2001. The futuristic building was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning French architect Christian de Portzamparc and cost \u20ac15 million to build. On the centenary of the birth of Herg\u00e9, 22 May 2007, the museum's first stone was laid. The museum opened its doors in June 2009.The idea of a museum dedicated to the work of Herg\u00e9 can be traced back to the end of the 1970s, when Herg\u00e9 was still alive. After his death in 1983, Herg\u00e9's widow, Fanny, led the efforts, undertaken at first by the Herg\u00e9 Foundation and then by the new Studios Herg\u00e9, to catalogue and choose the artwork and elements that would become part of the Museum's exhibitions.The Herg\u00e9 Museum contains eight permanent galleries displaying original artwork by Herg\u00e9, and telling the story of his life and career which had not previously been visible to the public. The Museum also houses a temporary exhibition gallery. Although Tintin features prominently in the museum, Herg\u00e9's other comic strip characters, such as Jo, Zette and Jocko, and Quick and Flupke, as well as his work as a graphic designer, are also present.

It is also known as Vyasa Purnima, the day believed to be both of his birth and when he divided the Vedas. Vyasa is considered one of the seven Chiranjivis (long-lived, or immortals), who are still in existence according to Hindu tradition.  Name Vyasa's birth name is Krishna Dvaipayana, which possibly refers to his dark complexion and birthplace, although he is more commonly known as \"Veda Vyasa\" (Veda Vy\u0101sa) as he has compiled the single, eternal Veda into four separate books \u2014 Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda.The word \"Vyasa\" (Vy\u0101sa) refers to \"compiler,\" or, \"arranger,\" and also means \"separation,\" or, \"division.\" Other meanings are \"split,\" \"differentiate,\" or, \"describe.\" It is also a title, given to \"a holy sage or a pious learned man,\" and applied to \"persons distinguished for their writings.\"Swami Vivekananda expresses the opinion that Vyasa may not have been a single person but a lineage of sages who were content to simply develop the ideas without claiming credit, as they were free from desire for the results of their work, and hence attributed the authorship to Vyasa. He says that Vyasa being only a title, anyone who composed a new Purana was known by the name Vyasa.Hindus traditionally hold that Vyasa subcategorized the primordial single Veda to produce four parts as a canonical collection. Hence he was called Veda Vyasa, or \"Splitter of the Vedas,\" the splitting being a feat that allowed people to understand the divine knowledge of the Veda. The Vishnu Purana elaborates on the role of Vyasa in Hindu chronology. The Hindu view of the universe is that of a cyclic phenomenon that comes into existence and dissolves repeatedly. Each kalpa cycle is presided over by a number of Manus, one for each manvantara, and each manvantara has a number of Yuga Cycles, each with four yuga ages of declining virtues. The Dvapara Yuga is the third yuga. The Vishnu Purana (Book 3, Ch 3) says: In every third world age (Dvapara), Vishnu, in the person of Vyasa, in order to promote the good of mankind, divides the Veda, which is properly but one, into many portions. Observing the limited perseverance, energy and application of mortals, he makes the Veda fourfold, to adapt it to their capacities; and the bodily form which he assumes, in order to effect that classification, is known by the name of Veda-Vyasa. Of the different Vyasas in the present Manvantara and the branches which they have taught, you shall have an account. Twenty-eight times have the Vedas been arranged by the great Rishis in the Vaivasvata Manvantara [...] and consequently, eight and twenty Vyasa's have passed away; by whom, in the respective periods, the Veda has been divided into four. The first... distribution was made by Svayambhu (Brahma) himself; in the second, the arranger of the Veda (Vyasa) was Prajapati [...] (and so on up to twenty-eight). According to the Vishnu Purana, Aswatthama, the son of Drona, will become the next sage (Vyasa) and will divide the Veda in 29th Maha Yuga of 7th Manvantara. Attributed texts The Mahabharata Vyasa is traditionally regarded as the chronicler of this epic and also features as an important character in Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The first section of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata states that it was Ganesha who wrote down the text to Vyasa's dictation, but this is regarded by scholars as a later interpolation to the epic and this part of the story is also excluded in the \"Critical Edition\" of the Mahabharata.The five Pandava brothers of the junior line of the Kuru royal house being the ultimate victors, thus India's cultural heroes, Vyasa's relationship with the winners in this kinship war of cousin against cousin is as chronicler who sired the father of the victors. These five protagonists are the surrogate sons of Pandu, sired by various gods on behalf of this Kuru king whom Vyasa himself fathered 'under Niyoga practice' in place of an elder brother who died heirless, at the behest of his mother Satyavati. Vyasa also sired the father of the vanquished, he was certainly the surgeon who put the hundred brothers of antagonist cousins into incubation, and as they are only said to be sired by a boon he conferred on their mother, there's some possibility that he is also their biological sire himself. Hence Vyasa's authorship of the Mahabharata is by way of biography of his own family including its adoptees. This was the struggle between his own ex officio grandsons. And it is in the wake of producing this purportedly historical, smiriti Mahabharata as well as 'compiling' the essential sruti scripture of the Vedas that 'Vyasa' was added as epithet then eclipsed his two birth names, Krishna and Dvaipayana, while his smiriti creation became a canon whose territorial name, drawing on either one or two lengendary ruler's personal names, included in the saga's text, still underlies modern Sanskrit-to-Hindi official form, Bh\u0101rat Ga\u1e47ar\u0101jya, in the names for India through its current constitution.Vyasa's Jaya (literally, \"victory\"), the core of the Mahabharata, is a dialogue between Dhritarashtra (the Kuru king and the father of the Kauravas, who opposed the P\u0101ndavas in the Kurukshetra War) and Sanjaya, his adviser and charioteer. Sanjaya narrates the particulars of the Kurukshetra War, fought in eighteen days, chronologically. Dhritarashtra at times asks questions and expresses doubts, sometimes lamenting, fearing the destruction the war would bring on his family, friends and kin. The Bhagavad Gita, Sanskrit, The Song of God, is contained in the Bhishma Parva which is chapters 23\u201340 of book 6 of the Mahabharata. The Gita, dated to the second half of the first millennium BCE, in its own right is one of the most influential philosophico-religious dialogues, producing numerous commentaries and a global audience. Like the \"Jaya\", it is also a dialogue, in which Pandava Prince Arjuna's hesitation to attack his cousins is counseled from 'the perspective of the gods' by his charioteer, revealed to be an avatar of Krishna. In 1981, Larson stated that \"a complete listing of Gita translations and a related secondary bibliography would be nearly endless\". The Bhagavad Gita has been highly praised, not only by prominent Indians including Mahatma Gandhi and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, but also by Aldous Huxley, Henry David Thoreau, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Carl Jung, Herman Hesse, and B\u00fclent Ecevit.In the Mahabharata, large and elaborate lists are given, describing hundreds of kingdoms, tribes, provinces, cities, towns, villages, rivers, mountains, forests, etc. of the (ancient) Indian subcontinent (Bh\u0101rata Varsha). Additionally, he gives descriptions of the military formations adopted by each side on each day, the death of individual heroes and the details of the war-races. Eighteen chapters of Vyasa's Jaya constitute the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred text in Hinduism. The Jaya deals with diverse subjects, such as geography, history, warfare, religion and morality. The 100,000 verses of Vyasa's work Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is told by Vaishampayana to Janamejaya. It is structured as a narration by Ugrasrava surnamed Sauti, a professional storyteller, to an assembly of rishis who, in the forest of Naimisha, had just attended the 12-year sacrifice known as Saunaka, surnamed Kulapati. At 100,000 verses, the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is the longest epic poem ever written. Other texts attributed Puranas Vyasa is also credited with the writing of the eighteen major Pur\u0101\u1e47as, which are works of Indian literature that cover an encyclopedic range of topics covering various scriptures. He narrated the Devi-Bhagavata Purana to Parikshit's son Janamejaya. Brahma Sutras The Brahma Sutras, one of the foundational texts of Vedanta, is written by Badarayana also known as Veda Vyasa. Badarayana is also called Vyasa, which literally means \"one who arranges\". In the Mahabharata Birth During her youth, Satyavati was a fisherwoman of Kaivartta clan who used to ferry people across river, to help her father. One day, she helped Parashara to cross the river Yamuna. He was enchanted by her beauty and wanted an heir from her. Initially, Satyavati did not agree, telling that if others would see them, then her purity would be questioned. Parashara created a secret place in bushes of a nearby island and a blanket of thick fog. She conceived and immediately gave birth to a son. Parashara named him Krishna Dvaipayana, referring to his dark complexion and birthplace. Dvaipayana became an adult and promised his mother that he would come to her when needed. Parashara restored Satyavati's virginity, gifted her an enchanting smell and left with his son. Satyavati kept this incident a secret, not telling even King Shantanu whom she was married to later. Niyoga and birth of Vichitravirya's sons Shantanu and Satyavati had two sons, named Chitr\u0101ngada and Vichitravirya. Both of them died early without leaving an heir, but Vichitravirya had two wives - Ambika and Ambalika. A widowed Satyavati initially asked her stepson, Bhishma, to marry both the queens, but he refused, citing his vow of celibacy. Satyavati revealed her secret past and requested him to bring her firstborn to impregnate the widows under a tradition called Niyoga. By this time, Vyasa had compiled the Vedas. Sage Vyasa was unkempt because of months of meditation in the forest. Hence upon seeing him, Ambika who was rather scared shut her eyes, resulting in their child, Dhritarashtra, being born blind. The other queen, Ambalika, turned pale upon meeting Vyasa, which resulted in their child, Pandu, being born pale. Alarmed, Satyavati requested that Vyasa meet Ambika again and grant her another son. Ambika instead sent her maid to meet Vyasa. The duty-bound maid was calm and composed; she had a healthy child who was later named Vidura. Connection with the Pandavas and Kauravas When the children of Vichitravirya grew up, Bhishma got them married to different women. Dhritarashtra was married to Gandhari, princess of Gandhara. Pandu married Kunti and Madri. Pandu left the kingdom, leaving Dhritarashtra as the acting king. Gandhari, during her adolescence, received a boon to have a hundred children but her pregnancy was taking a long period of time. After two years of pregnancy, Gandhari aborted her developing fetus, giving birth to a hard mass that looked like an iron ball. Vyasa came to the kingdom and using his knowledge, he asked to divide the mass into one hundred and one-pieces and put them into pots for incubation. After a year, 101 babies were born. Meanwhile Pandu's wives, Kunti and Madri, were blessed with three and two sons respectively.While everybody rejoiced at the news of the birth of the Pandavas and Kauravas, misery took place in the forest. Pandu, who was cursed, died because of his attempt to make love with Madri. Kunti and the Pandavas returned to Hastinapura. Vyasa, feeling sorrow for his mother's fate, asked her to leave the kingdom and come with him to live a peaceful life. Satyavati, along with her two daughters-in-law, went to the forest. Disciples Vyasa had a son named Shuka, who was his spiritual successor and heir. As per Skanda Purana, Vyasa married Vatik\u0101, alias Pinjal\u0101, who was the daughter of a sage named J\u0101b\u0101li. It is described that Vyasa's union with her produced his heir, who repeated everything that he heard, thus receiving the name Shuka (lit. Parrot). Other texts including the Devi Bhagavata Purana also narrate the birth of Shuka but with drastic differences. Vyasa was desiring an heir, when an apsara (celestial damsel) named Ghritachi flew in front of him in form of a beautiful parrot, causing him sexual arousal. He discharges his semen, which fell on some sticks and a son developed. This time, he was named Shuka because of the role of the celestial parrot. Shuka appears occasionally in the story as a spiritual guide to the young Kuru princes. Besides his heir, Vyasa had four other disciples \u2014 Paila, Jaimini, Vaishampayana and Sumantu. Each one of them was given the responsibility to spread one of the four Vedas. Paila was the made the incharge of Rigveda, Jaimini of the Samaveda, Vaishampayana of the Yajurveda and Sumantu of Atharvaveda.Vyasa is believed to have lived on the banks of Ganga in modern-day Uttarakhand. The site was also the ritual home of the sage Vashishta, along with the Pandavas, the five brothers of the Mahabharata.Vyasa is also mentioned in the Sankara Digvijaya. He confronts Adi Shankara, who has written a commentary on the Brahma-Sutras, in the form of an old Brahmana, and asks for an explanation of the first Sutra. This develops into a debate between Shankara and Vyasa which lasts for eight days. Recognizing the old Brahmana to be Vyasa, Shankara makes obeisance and sings a hymn in his praise. Thereupon, Vyasa inspects and approves Shankara's commentary on the Brahma-Sutras. Adi Shankara, who was supposed to die at the end of his sixteenth year, express his desire to leave his body in the presence of Vyasa. Vyasa dissuades him and blesses him that he may live for another sixteen years to complete his work. Festival The festival of Guru Purnima is dedicated to Vyasa. It is also known as Vyasa Purnima, the day believed to be both of his birth and when he divided the Vedas. In Sikhism In Brahm Avtar, one of the compositions in Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh mentions Rishi Vyas as an avatar of Brahma. He is considered the fifth incarnation of Brahma. Guru Gobind Singh wrote a brief account of Rishi Vyas's compositions about great kings\u2014 Manu, Prithu, Bharath, Jujat, Ben, Mandata, Dilip, Raghu Raj and Aj\u2014 and attributed to him the store of Vedic learning.

Yaguchi first arrived in the United States on June 5, 1965, and continues to reside in the US to the present day. In 1974, Yaguchi founded the ISKF of Colorado, the regional headquarters for the Mountain States Region.  Early life Yaguchi was born on November 14, 1932, in Kure, a suburb of Hiroshima, Japan, on November 14, 1932 into a farming family. The youngest of five children, he had a carefree youth but was aware of the clouds of war. World War II impacted his life, at the end of the war, when he was assigned a job at a shipyard. On the morning of August 6, 1945, while he was waiting to enter the factory building at the shipyard, he saw the flash of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.After the war, Yutaka Yaguchi was able to resume his education, and was even able to go to university, unlike many of his former school mates. He went to Nihon University in Tokyo, and this is where he first started Shotokan karate. He also joined the JKA at that time. Training was very intense and heavily oriented to conditioning. Mr. Yaguchi graduated with a degree in Marine Biology, but was averse to sailing. After graduation, he found a job with a construction company.One day in 1957, Sensei Masatoshi Nakayama asked Mr. Yaguchi to quit his job and join the JKA Instructor Training program full-time. Yaguchi quit his job the very next day and enrolled. When he graduated from the program in 1959, he was the fourth graduate behind Hirokazu Kanazawa, Takayuki Mikami, and Eiji Takaura. Competitive karate career Early tournaments Although Gichin Funakoshi, the founder of Shotokan karate, was adamantly opposed to tournaments, Masatoshi Nakayama was convinced that the future of karate depended on using tournaments to popularize karate to a worldwide audience. At the first JKA All-Japan Karate Championships in 1957, Yutaka Yaguchi achieved the unfortunate distinction of being the first contestant to foul out. Over the next half dozen years or so, he faced many of the greatest karate competitors, many who have subsequently been recognized as true masters of the art: Hirokazu Kanazawa, Hiroshi Shirai, Keinosuke Enoeda, Tetsuhiko Asai, Takayuki Mikami, etc. United States Sensei Nakayama sent Yutaka Yaguchi to America in 1965, and he began teaching in Sensei Hidetaka Nishiyama's dojo in Los Angeles. Soon after, he was invited to teach in Denver, CO, by Joe Castillo, and he relocated there for about a year, but finances were extremely tight. He returned to California and continued to teach at Sensei Nishiyama's dojo through the late 1960s and early 1970s. Colorado In 1972, the year Sensei Yaguchi permanently relocated back to Denver, he was the coach for the US team at the 1972 Shotocup World Tournament in France. This was a very controversial tournament that ended up with the US team walking out of the tournament under objections to unfair refereeing. In addition, Joe Castillo (the karate instructor who had originally invited Sensei Yaguchi to Denver in 1966) died. It was a time of upheaval in the new dojo, with many divided loyalties. After things began to settle down, the dojo began to grow. ISKF Formation Tension among the Japanese instructors in the AAKF, the American organization recognized by the JKA, lead to a heated meeting at the Olympic Motel in Los Angeles in 1977, which resulted in the split of the organization into two. Hidetaka Nishiyama retained control of the AAKF. The only Japanese instructor at the meeting who stayed with Nishiyama was Sensei Masataka Mori. The other five instructors formed a new organization called the ISKF: Teruyuki Okazaki, Takayuki Mikami, Yutaka Yaguchi, Shojiro Koyama, and Shigeru Takashina. The first organizational meeting was held in Denver, Colorado in 1978. Independence In June 2007, Okazaki made the decision to split away from the JKA. In this decision, he was supported by Sensei Yaguchi; however, the other three Japanese masters that were part of the ISKF hierarchy decided to remain with the JKA: Takayuki Mikami, Shojiro Koyama, and Shigeru Takashina. As Vice Chairman of the ISKF, and as Chairman of the ISKF technical committee, Sensei Yaguchi has played a central role in the future growth of the ISKF in the United States and around the world.

Individually, Torres also earned bronze medals \u2013 her first Olympic medals in individual events \u2013 in each of the 50-meter freestyle, the 100-meter butterfly and the 100-meter freestyle, tying teammate and rival Jenny Thompson for third place in the last event. At 33 years old, Torres became the oldest woman to win an Olympic medal in swimming. She was the oldest member of the U.S. Olympic swim team, but won more medals (five) than any other U.S. team member. Second comeback: 2008 Olympics On August 1, 2007, at age 40 and just 16 months after giving birth to her first child, Torres won the 100-meter freestyle at the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis. On August 4, she set a new American record in the 50-meter freestyle of 24.53 seconds, breaking her own record of 24.63 seconds set at the 2000 Summer Olympics. She lowered her initial American record by 1.62 seconds. Torres has broken or lowered her own American record in the 50-meter freestyle 10 times, which is the most by any American swimmer in any event.At the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials, Torres returned to the pool and qualified for a spot in her fifth Olympic Games at the age of 41, a first for an American female swimmer. She became the oldest U.S. Olympic swimmer in history and the first American swimmer to appear in five Olympic Games.At the trials, she qualified for the event finals in the 50-meter freestyle and broke the American record with a time of 24.38 seconds in the semifinal. In the 50-meter finals, she broke that record for the ninth time, setting it at 24.25 seconds and winning the top American women's spot in the event. Torres also qualified in the 100-meter freestyle, but later withdrew from the individual 100-meter freestyle event to focus her efforts on the 50-meter freestyle and 4\u00d7100-meter relay events. On July 30, at the U.S. swim team's final training in Singapore, Torres, Amanda Beard, and Natalie Coughlin were elected captains of the U.S. Olympic women's swimming team.In order to pre-empt any speculation that she might be taking performance-enhancing drugs, Torres volunteered for a new enhanced drug-testing program by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. \"I want to be an open book\", she said. \"I want people to know that I'm 41, and I'm doing this right. I'm clean.\" In addition to employing her training team of coach Michael Lohberg, a sprint coach, a chiropractor, and two masseuses, Torres used resistance-stretching trainers, calling it her \"secret weapon\" for continued success. Her $100,000-per-year training costs were partially subsidized by her corporate sponsors Speedo, Toyota, and Bloomberg L.P.\"I think this performance ranks up there with the biggest performances in sports ever ... It puts Dara in the ranks of Michael Phelps, Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods. What she has done is really not measurable.\" Michael Lohberg, Torres's coach, discussing her winning three Olympic silver medals at the age of 41.At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Torres won a silver medal as the anchor swimmer of the second-place U.S. team in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay. It was the fifth time in five tries she earned an Olympic medal in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay. With the American relay team's second-place finish, she became the oldest swimmer to win a medal in Olympic history, surpassing British swimmer William Robinson, who was 38 at the time of the 1908 Summer Olympics.On August 17, 2008, she won the silver medal in the 50-meter freestyle, finishing in a new American record time of 24.07 seconds, one one-hundredth (0.01) of a second behind the winner, Britta Steffen. Her second-place time was a new American record, and 0.18 of a second faster than she swam at the U.S. Olympic Trials. Thirty-five minutes later, she won another silver medal swimming the freestyle anchor leg for the second-place U.S. team in the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay. Her split on the 4\u00d7100 medley relay (52.27 seconds) was the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in relay history. The American record for the women's 100-meter freestyle as an individual event was 53.39 seconds as of August 2008, making Torres's time more than a full second faster.Torres's 12 Olympic medals tied the all-time medal record for a female Olympic swimmer set by fellow American Jenny Thompson in 2004; American Natalie Coughlin subsequently equaled the record in 2012. Aftermath and retirement At the U.S. National Championships in 2009, Torres won the 50-meter freestyle with the fourth-best time in the world for the year (24.42), and she also placed in the 50-meter butterfly, qualifying her to compete in those events at the 2009 World Championships. This was the first time since 1986 that Torres competed in the World Championships; she placed eighth in the 50-meter freestyle and she did not advance beyond the qualifying heats in the 50-meter butterfly.Following reconstructive surgery of one of her knees, she began training with the goal of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics. At the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, she placed fourth in the finals of the 50-meter freestyle, 0.32 of a second behind the winner, Jessica Hardy, and 0.09 of a second behind the second qualifier, Kara Lynn Joyce. Only the top-two finishers in each trials event qualified for the 2012 U.S. Olympic team, and as a result, Torres concluded her Olympic career. After the 2012 Trials, Torres announced her retirement from competitive swimming, concluding her career with 12 Olympic medals. Her Olympic career spanned 24 years from 1984 to 2008 and five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000, 2008).In 2004 she was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. Life outside swimming Torres has worked in television as a reporter and announcer for American networks NBC, ESPN, TNT, OLN, and Fox News Channel, and hosted the golf show, The Clubhouse on the Resort Sports Network. She has also worked as a model, and was the first elite swimmer to model swimwear in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, appearing in the 1994 edition. She was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.After 1992, she married and subsequently divorced sports producer Jeff Gowen. After 2000, she converted to Judaism fully (she was already half Jewish through her father) before marrying the Israeli surgeon Itzhak Shasha. Torres and Shasha later divorced. Torres and reproductive endocrinologist David Hoffman began dating after her break-up with Shasha, and they became the parents of Tessa Grace Torres-Hoffman, born in 2006. After the birth of their daughter, Hoffman, a masters swimmer, persuaded her to begin training again.Torres is a veteran celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America, a charitable organization that raises funds for cancer research in which she has participated for several years. She is the author of two books: Age is Just a Number: Achieve Your Dreams at Any Stage in Your Life (with Elizabeth Weil), and Gold Medal Fitness: A Revolutionary 5-Week Program (with Billie Fitzpatrick).Torres is also involved with the American chapter of the foundation of Princess Charlene of Monaco, a charitable organization at which she sits, as Vice-President, on the board of directors.In August 2019, Torres joined CaniBrands, a CBD health and wellness company, as its Chief Wellness and Lifestyle Officer.

Biography Miller was born the son of a tavern owner in Lynchburg, Virginia. Miller studied law under Judge Archibald Stewart of Staunton before moving to Rogersville, Tennessee, in 1796. Following his move from Rogersville to Knoxville in 1800, where he practiced law with Thomas Emmerson, Miller was married to Mary Louisa Blount, daughter of Tennessee statesman William Blount. He became known as one of the best criminal trial lawyers in Tennessee because of his wit and oratorical skills. Career Elected chairman, Miller served as one of the commissioners for the government of Knoxville in 1801 and 1802. He was a leader of the Blount-Jackson political faction, and elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Eleventh Congress, which lasted from March 4, 1809 to March 4, 1811. He moved to west Tennessee in approximately 1824 and was chancellor of that division in 1836 and 1837.In 1811 Miller was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives and helped secure the creation of the Bank of the State of Tennessee.

Being a friend of Henry V, he long escaped prosecution for heresy. When convicted, he escaped from the Tower of London and then led a rebellion against the King. Eventually, he was captured and executed in London. He formed the basis for William Shakespeare's character John Falstaff, who was originally called John Oldcastle.  Family Oldcastle's date of birth is unknown, although dubious and possibly apocryphal sources place it variously at 1360 or 1378, although 1370 is most likely closer to the truth.His parents were Richard and Isabel Oldcastle of Almeley, Herefordshire. His grandfather, also called John Oldcastle, was Herefordshire's MP during the latter part of the reign of King Richard II. Early life Oldcastle is first mentioned in two separate documents in 1400, first as a plaintiff in a suit regarding the advowson of Almeley church, and again as serving as a knight under Lord Grey of Codnor in a military expedition to Scotland.Over the next few years, Oldcastle held notable positions in the Welsh campaigns of King Henry IV of England against Owain Glynd\u0175r, including captaincy first over Builth Castle in Brecknockshire and then over Kidwelly.Oldcastle represented Herefordshire as a \"knight of the shire\" in the parliament of 1404, later serving as a justice of the peace, and was High Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1406\u201307.In 1408, he married Joan, the heiress of Cobham \u2014 his third marriage, and her fourth. This resulted in a significant improvement of his fortune and status, as the Cobhams were \"one of the most notable families of Kent\". The marriage brought Oldcastle a number of manors in Kent, Norfolk, Northamptonshire and Wiltshire, as well as Cooling Castle, and from 1409 until his accusation in 1413 he was summoned to parliament as Lord Cobham.At some point in his military career, Oldcastle became a trusted supporter of Henry, Prince of Wales, later to become King Henry V, who regarded Sir John as \"one of his most trustworthy soldiers\".Oldcastle was a member of the expedition which the young Henry sent to France in 1411 in a successful campaign to assist the Burgundians in the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War. Lollardy Lollardy had many supporters in Herefordshire, and Oldcastle himself had adopted Lollard doctrines before 1410, when the churches on his wife's estates in Kent were laid under interdict for unlicensed preaching. In the convocation which met in March 1413, shortly before the death of Henry IV, Oldcastle was at once accused of heresy. But his friendship with the new King Henry V prevented any decisive action until convincing evidence was found in one of Oldcastle's books, which was discovered in a shop in Paternoster Row, London. The matter was brought before the King, who desired that nothing should be done until he had tried his personal influence. Oldcastle declared his readiness to submit to the king \"all his fortune in this world\" but was firm in his religious beliefs. When Oldcastle fled from Windsor Castle to his own castle at Cooling, Henry at last consented to a prosecution. Oldcastle refused to obey the archbishop's repeated citations, and it was only under a Royal Writ that he at last appeared before the ecclesiastical court on 23 September 1413. In a confession of his faith he declared his belief in the sacraments and the necessity of penance and true confession, but he would not assent to the orthodox doctrine of the sacrament as stated by the Bishops, nor admit the necessity of confession to a priest. He also said the veneration of images was \"the great sin of idolatry\". On 25 September he was convicted as a heretic. King Henry V was still anxious to find a way of escape for his old comrade, and granted a respite of forty days. Before that time had expired, Oldcastle escaped from the Tower by the help of one William Fisher, a parchment-maker of Smithfield. Open rebellion Oldcastle now put himself at the head of a widespread Lollard conspiracy, which assumed a definite political character. The plan was to seize the King and his brothers during a Twelfth-night mumming at Eltham, and establish some sort of commonwealth. Oldcastle was to be Regent, the king, nobility and clergy placed under restraint, and the abbeys dissolved and their riches shared out. King Henry, forewarned of their intention by a spy, moved to London, and when the Lollards assembled in force in St Giles's Fields on 10 January they were easily dispersed by the king and his forces.Oldcastle himself escaped into deepest northwest Herefordshire, and for nearly four years avoided capture. He is believed to have been privy to the Southampton Plot in July 1415, when he stirred some movement in the Welsh Marches. On the failure of the scheme he went again into hiding. Capture and death In November 1417 his hiding-place was at last discovered and he was captured by Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Cherleton. Some historians believed he was captured in the upland Olchon Valley of western Herefordshire adjacent to the Black Mountains, Wales, not far from the village of Oldcastle itself in his family's old heartlands. He is said to have been hiding with some Lollard friends at a glade on Pant-mawr farm in Broniarth, Wales, called Cobham's Garden.The principal agents in the capture were four of the tenants of Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Cherleton, two of them being Ieuan and Sir Gruffudd Vychan, sons of Gruffudd ap Ieuan.Oldcastle who was \"sore wounded ere he would be taken\", was brought to London in a horse-litter. The reward for his capture was awarded to Baron Cherleton, but he died before receiving it, though a portion was paid to his widow in 1422. On 14 December he was formally condemned, on the record of his previous conviction, and that same day was hanged in St Giles's Fields, and burnt \"gallows and all\". It is not clear whether he was burnt alive or hanged and quartered first. Literary portrayals His heretical opinions and early friendship with Henry V created a traditional scandal which long continued. In the old play The Famous Victories of Henry V, written before 1588, Oldcastle figures as the Prince's boon companion. When Shakespeare adapted that play in Henry IV, Part 1, Oldcastle still appeared, but when the play was printed in 1598, the name was changed to Falstaff (modelled after Sir John Fastolf), in deference to one of Oldcastle's descendants, Lord Cobham. Although the fat knight still remains \"my old lad of the Castle\", the stage character has nothing to do with the Lollard leader. In Henry IV, Part 2 an epilogue emphasises that Falstaff is not Oldcastle: \"Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already a' be killed with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man.\" In 1599, another play, Sir John Oldcastle, presented Oldcastle in a more kindly light. Bibliography The record of Oldcastle's trial is printed in Fasciculi Zizaniorum (Rolls series) and in David Wilkins's Concilia, iii. 351\u2013357. The chief contemporary notices of his later career are given in Gesta Henrici Quinti (Eng. Hist. Soc.) and in Walsingham's Historia Anglicana. There have been many lives of Oldcastle, mainly based on The Actes and Monuments of John Foxe, who in his turn followed the Briefe Chronycle of John Bale, first published in 1544.

His two main philosophies were socialism and nationalism, but by 1908 at the latest, after years of uneasy agnosticism, he had become a believing but non-practicing Roman Catholic.\nFrom that time, Catholicism strongly influenced his works.  Biography P\u00e9guy was born into poverty in Orl\u00e9ans. His mother C\u00e9cile, widowed when he was an infant, mended chairs for a living. His father D\u00e9sir\u00e9 P\u00e9guy was a cabinet maker, who died in 1874 as a result of combat wounds. P\u00e9guy studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Lakanal in Sceaux, winning a scholarship at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (Paris), where he attended notably the lectures of Henri Bergson and Romain Rolland, whom he befriended. He formally left without graduating, in 1897, though he continued attending some lectures in 1898. Influenced by Lucien Herr, librarian of the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, he became an ardent Dreyfusard. In 1897, P\u00e9guy married Charlotte-Fran\u00e7oise Baudoin; they had one daughter and three sons, one of whom was born after P\u00e9guy's death. Around 1910 he fell deeply in love with Blanche Raphael, a young Jewish friend; however, he was faithful to his wife. From his earliest years, he was influenced by socialism. He joined the Socialist Party in 1895. From 1900 until his death in 1914, he was the main contributor to and the editor of the literary magazine Les Cahiers de la Quinzaine, which at first supported the Socialist Party director Jean Jaur\u00e8s. However, P\u00e9guy ultimately ended this support after he began viewing Jaur\u00e8s as a traitor to the nation and to socialism. In the Cahiers, P\u00e9guy published not only his own essays and poetry, but also works by important contemporary authors such as Romain Rolland. His free-verse poem, \"Portico of the Mystery of the Second Virtue\", has gone through more than 60 editions in France. It was a favorite book of Charles de Gaulle. When the First World War broke out, P\u00e9guy became a lieutenant in the 19th company of the French 276th Infantry Regiment. He died in battle, shot in the forehead, near Villeroy, Seine-et-Marne on the day before the beginning of the Battle of the Marne. There is a memorial to P\u00e9guy near the field where he was killed. Influence During the Second World War both supporters and opponents of Vichy France cited P\u00e9guy. Edmond Michelet was the first of many members of the French Resistance to quote P\u00e9guy; de Gaulle, familiar with P\u00e9guy's writing, quoted him a 1942 speech. Those who opposed Vichy's anti-Semitism laws often cited him. By contrast, Robert Brasillach praised P\u00e9guy as a \"French National Socialist\", and P\u00e9guy's sons Pierre and Marcel wrote that their father was an inspiration for Vichy's National Revolution ideology and \"above all, a racist\". It has been written that P\u00e9guy would likely have been horrified by his future influence on fascism.The English novelist Graham Greene alluded to P\u00e9guy in Brighton Rock, while The Heart of the Matter has as its epigraph a quotation from P\u00e9guy. In The Lawless Roads Greene refers to P\u00e9guy \"challenging God in the cause of the damned\".The Swiss theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, in the course of describing the history of art as an ongoing, sometimes more and sometimes less successful approximation of God's creativeness, noted that P\u00e9guy's Eve was a \"theological redemption of the project of Proust\", meaning that where Proust was gifted with memory and charity, the Eve of P\u00e9guy \u2013 not necessarily P\u00e9guy himself \u2013 was gifted with memory, charity, and direct knowledge of the redemption of God.English poet Geoffrey Hill published a book-length poem in 1983 in homage to P\u00e9guy, entitled The Mystery of the Charity of Charles P\u00e9guy. Famous quotations \"The world has changed more in the last 30 years [since 1909] than in all the time since Jesus Christ.\"\"The sinner is at the very heart of Christianity. Nobody is so competent as the sinner in matters of Christianity. Nobody, except the saint.\" This is the epigraph to Graham Greene's novel The Heart of the Matter (1948).\"It will never be known what acts of cowardice have been committed for fear of not looking sufficiently progressive.\" (Notre Patrie, 1905) \"Tyranny is always better organised than freedom\".\"Kantian ethics has clean hands but, in a manner of speaking, actually no hands.\"\"How maddening, says God, it will be when there are no longer any Frenchmen.\"\"There will be things that I do that no one will be left to understand.\" (Le Myst\u00e8re des saints Innocents) \"It is impossible to write ancient history because we do not have enough sources, and impossible to write modern history because we have too many\".

Inspired by the George Reeves Superman TV series, he began writing short stories and drawing pictures. Living in Aberdeen, Washington, he studied art and journalism at Grays Harbor College and Clark College, receiving an Associate in Arts degree from Grays Harbor in 1970.  Career Working in and around the Aberdeen area from 1967 to 1975, Workman created local and regional advertising, always attempting to do the ad work in comics form whenever he was allowed to do so. He also did comics fanzine work, writing and drawing for several different publications, including fanzines overseen by Rick Spanier (Assorted Superlatives) and by Mark Wheatley. In 1968, he met gag cartoonist Carl Stamwitz who had worked for Marvel Comics in their humor magazines. He was further encouraged when he met and had numerous conversations with the legendary writer-artist Basil Wolverton in 1969. He got his start in comics publishing on a national level in 1972 by writing and drawing two four-page comics features, \"Sindy\" and \"The Fallen Angels,\" that appeared for three years in two California-based men's magazines published by Archie Comics alumnus Ed Goldstein. Using different pseudonyms (one being E. L. Bert), Workman also wrote short prose stories that appeared in the magazines alongside stories by Harlan Ellison and Robert Bloch. Two years later, in the pages of Mike Friedrich's Star*Reach, he wrote, penciled, inked and lettered stories for the seminal fantasy\/science fiction comics anthology. Workman's work on Star*Reach attracted attention from DC Comics, and they offered him a production job in 1975.Workman was art director of Heavy Metal magazine from 1977 to 1984. His comics art, writing, lettering, coloring and design work are evident throughout issues from that period. Lettering From 1977-1983, Workman lettered comics occasionally (mostly for DC); he has been working steadily as a freelance letterer since 1983. Some of the regular titles he has lettered include First Comics' Grimjack from 1984 to 1987, Marvel's Fantastic Four from 1985 to 1989, Cosmic Odyssey in 1988\u20131989, Fantastic Force from 1994\u20131996, The Incredible Hulk from 1997\u20131999, and Spider-Girl from 2000\u20132002. For DC Comics, Workman lettered Doom Patrol from 1987\u20131995, the Legion of Super-Heroes from 1991\u20131993, Michael Moorcock's Multiverse in 1997\u20131998, and Aquaman in 1999\u20132000. Workman handled lettering chores for Topps Comics' X-Files titles in the late 1990s, and Image Comics' Savage Dragon from 2003\u20132005. Since 2003, he has done a lot of lettering work for Archie Comics, especially for their Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man titles. He has created logos for many of their super-hero characters and has done interior lettering on both New Crusaders and The Fox. Walt Simonson Workman has worked on many of Walt Simonson\u2019s projects, including Thor (Marvel, 1983\u20131987), Balder the Brave (Marvel, 1985), Jurassic Park (Topps, 1993), Robocop vs. Terminator, Star Slammers (Bravura\/Malibu, 1994), Orion (DC, 2000\u20132002), and \"Ragnarok.\" Tommy Lee Edwards Recently Workman has lettered much of the Marvel, DC and Wildstorm work of Tommy Lee Edwards, including Gemini Blood (1996\u20131997), The Question (2005), Bullet Points (2007), Turf, Marvel 1985 (2008) for which he won the 2009 Harvey Award for lettering, and DC's \"Mother Panic\" (2016).\" Writing, artwork and design In addition to the thousands of comics pages that he has lettered, Workman has also written and\/or drawn for DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Archie Comics, National Lampoon, Playboy, Hamilton Publishing, Image Comics, and others. He wrote an introduction and the final chapter in Bhob Stewart's Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood and contributed a short autobiographical piece in comics form to the TwoMorrows book Streetwise. Working in an art style similar to that of artist Mike Sekowsky, he pencilled and inked three of the dust jackets for the hardcover DC Comics Justice League Archives series. He wrote and drew the 41-page \"Adventures of Roma\" which ran in consecutive issues of Dark Horse Presents in 1987. Workman's early science fiction and girlie-humor strips \"Sindy\" and \"The Fallen Angels\" were collected in a five-issue run by Forbidden Fruit, an imprint of Apple Comics. Wild Things, a three-issue series published by Metro Comics, was made up mostly of material created by Workman for such diverse publications as Star*Reach and Heavy Metal. In July 2013, a reformatted graphic novel version of \"The Adventures of Roma\" with new art and additional story material was published in both hardbound and softcover editions by CO2 Comics. For the Fantagraphics imprint Eros Comix, Workman wrote and designed Betty Being Bad (1990), a 48-page booklet about pin-up model Betty Page. He also wrote and designed two hardcovers for Heavy Metal Books, Heavy Metal: 25 Years of Classic Covers and Innocent Images. A self-published booklet,\"The Comic Book Crisis,\" which examined the business side of comic books was incorporated (with additional new material) into issue 199 of The Comics Journal, featuring commentary by Mike Friedrich, Steve Geppi, Kurt Busiek, Gary Groth and others. Through his own Neonarcheos Publishing imprint, Workman has published limited editions of \"Writing, Penciling, Inking, Lettering, Editing Martelaine,\" \"The Third Man,\" \"The Art of John Workman,\" and both black-and-white and color posters of pages of his artwork. Lettering style Workman is noted for his distinct lettering style, tight craftsmanship, and the fact that for the most part he still does traditional lettering on art boards instead of using the computer and digital fonts. One of Workman's lettering trademarks is to often erase or omit panel borders when they touch the top, side or bottom of a word balloon or caption, thus opening up the balloon\/caption to the gutter. In this regard, Workman's lettering style is similar to that of the late Bill Oakley. Workman's lettering style was highly influenced by the lettering of Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud from the time when Moebius appeared regularly in the pages of Heavy Metal.Because he does most of his lettering by hand, Workman's collaboration is sought by those artists who wish to have a more cohesive and integrated look to the final artwork. (A joke in the comic book community goes that \"Comic books are the only place where having 'Workmanlike' craftsmanship is a plus.\")Recently, however, even Workman has moved toward digital lettering. In addition to his \"on-the-art boards work,\" Workman has been electronically hand-lettering by way of a WACOM tablet for such books as Torchwood, Mega Man, Thor, Turf, DC's \"Before Watchmen\" series Ozymandias, Superman: American Alien, and the latest incarnation of the Batman title. Personal life Workman is married to the former Cathy Foster, whom he met at Aberdeen's Eaton's Bookstall when she was looking for issues of Lois Lane drawn by Kurt Schaffenberger, and the two have a daughter named Kate, a writer who is the author of two Sherlock Holmes novels. His brother Bill worked beside him on-staff at Heavy Metal magazine. Both were in the 2000 Jon Cryer film Went to Coney Island on a Mission from God... Be Back by Five. Notes References Field, Todd.

Early years Jones attended Okeechobee High School, but because he had to work to help support his mother, he didn't play football until his junior year when he only played in the last 4 games of the season, nevertheless, he still led the team in sacks and was third in tackles. He would miss all of his senior season football games, because he had to work in a drugstore during the team's summer workouts and the new head coach put in place a policy that left him out of the team.His high school athletic director (Jim Kirk) sent a highlight tape of his only games as a starter to different colleges, which eventually helped him get a football scholarship from the University of Miami. He was a backup defensive end as a redshirt freshman. As a sophomore, he started the season opener at right defensive tackle. The next week he broke his hand in practice, but still managed to finish the season second on the team in quarterback pressures and posted a career-high 12 tackles against East Carolina University.As a junior, he started the final 4 games at right defensive tackle, registering 8 tackles and 2 sacks in the 23-3 win against the University of Nebraska in the 1989 Orange Bowl. As a senior, he was forced to miss spring workouts in order to earn money as a valet attendant at a restaurant, giving Cortez Kennedy the edge to start at right defensive tackle. He missed 3 games with a knee injury. He rotated with Kennedy and Russell Maryland, helping the team lead the nation in scoring defense and total defense. He finished his college career winning two national championships (1987 and 1989), while recording 105 tackles, 68 assists and 16+1\u20442 sacks. Professional career Dallas Cowboys Although he was a backup during his college career, Jones was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (64th overall) of the 1990 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he had his best year, working as the primary backup at both defensive tackle positions and starting a total of six games, with five games replacing an injured Dean Hamel. At the end of the season, he finished tied with defensive end Danny Stubbs for the team lead with 7 1\/2 sacks, while adding 60 tackles, three passes defensed and 14 quarterback pressures. He also ranked sixth among all interior lineman in the NFL in sacks and was voted to the All-rookie team. Jones and DeMarcus Ware are the only rookies to ever lead or tie for the Cowboys' team lead in sacks. In 1991, he started five games at right defensive tackle. He finished the season with 33 tackles, six tackles for loss (second on the team), two sacks and 10 quarterback pressures. In 1992, he started the season opener at left defensive tackle in place of an injured Tony Casillas, making five tackles (two for loss), and one quarterback pressure. He also started in the third game against the Phoenix Cardinals. He finished the season with 23 tackles, four sacks, 11 quarterback pressures and one forced fumble.

He also was a part of one of the most famous Thanksgiving football plays, when he blocked a 41-yard field goal attempt from the Miami Dolphins' Pete Stoyanovich, to preserve what seemed an apparent 14-13 victory, but as the ball rolled toward the Cowboys' end zone, Leon Lett kicked the ball and the Dolphins recovered. Stoyanovich would go on to convert a second field goal with three seconds left, giving the Dolphins a 16-14 victory.During his four-year Cowboys career, he helped the team win two Super Bowls against the Buffalo Bills twice, played a total of 65 games, starting 16 and recording 19 sacks. He was an effective pass rusher who got most of his playing time on passing downs, and was key backup in the best defense and best defensive line rotation in the NFL. Los Angeles\/St. Louis Rams On March 4, 1994, the Los Angeles Rams signed Jones to a four-year contract for $7.7 million, including a $2 signing bonus. He played in 14 games (starting all) and recorded five sacks. In 1995, the Rams owner Georgia Frontiere, moved the franchise to St. Louis, Missouri. Jones started 16 games at left defensive tackle and did not record a sack. In 1996, he started 16 games, registering 61 tackles and 5.5 sacks.

Although he received some support from Wei's rival state Eastern Wu, his rebellion was eventually suppressed by Wei imperial forces and he met his end at the hands of Hu Fen, a military officer under Sima Zhao.  Early career Zhuge Dan was from Yangdu County (\u967d\u90fd\u7e23), Langya Commandery (\u7405\u90aa\u90e1), which is in present-day Yinan County, Shandong. He was a descendant of Zhuge Feng (\u8af8\u845b\u8c50) and a cousin of Zhuge Jin and Zhuge Liang. He started his career as a Gentleman of Writing (\u5c1a\u66f8\u90ce). There was once when he and Du Ji, a Supervisor (\u4ec6\u5c04), test-rode a boat in the river. The boat capsized after being hit by a wave and both men were thrown overboard. When the huben guards came to save him, Zhuge Dan told them to save Du Ji first. He lost consciousness later, drifted to the shore, and eventually recovered.Later, Zhuge Dan became the Prefect (\u4ee4) of Xingyang County (\u6ece\u967d\u7e23) and then served as a Gentleman (\u90ce) in the Ministry of Personnel (\u540f\u90e8). During this time, when his colleagues recommended people to him, he would publicly reveal what they told him in private before giving jobs to the people they recommended. When he evaluated officials' performance, he would take into account what others said regardless of whether it was positive or negative. As a result, his colleagues were especially careful when they recommended people to him.After gaining some experience in the Ministry of Personnel, Zhuge Dan was then reassigned to be a Palace Assistant Imperial Secretary and Master of Writing (\u5fa1\u53f2\u4e2d\u4e1e\u5c1a\u66f8). He was close friends with Xiahou Xuan and Deng Yang. They enjoyed much praise from other officials and the citizens in the imperial capital. Later, someone told the Wei emperor Cao Rui that Zhuge Dan and his friends, along with other \"celebrities\", were engaging in superficial and fame-seeking behaviour. Cao Rui felt disgusted and wanted to discourage such behaviour among his subjects, so he removed Zhuge Dan from office.After Cao Rui's death in 239, Cao Fang became the new Wei emperor. He restored Zhuge Dan as Palace Assistant Imperial Secretary and Master of Writing, and subsequently promoted him to Inspector (\u523a\u53f2) of Yang Province and General of Illustrious Martial Might (\u662d\u6b66\u5c07\u8ecd). Battle of Dongxing In 251, Wei imperial forces led by the regent Sima Yi suppressed a rebellion by the Wei general Wang Ling. After that, the Wei imperial court appointed Zhuge Dan as General Who Guards the East (\u93ae\u6771\u5c07\u8ecd), granted him imperial authority, put him in charge of military affairs in Yang Province, and enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Shanyang Village (\u5c71\u967d\u4ead\u4faf). After Sima Yi died later that year, his son Sima Shi succeeded him as regent and continued to control the Wei government.Around early or mid 252, Zhuge Dan pointed out to Sima Shi that Eastern Wu forces had been making incursions on Wei territory and had constructed a large dam, complete with exterior defences, at Dongxing (\u6771\u8208; southeast of present-day Chaohu, Anhui). He suggested to Sima Shi to send Wang Chang and Guanqiu Jian to lead troops to attack and destroy the dam. Later that year, Sima Shi devised a strategy for launching a three-pronged attack on Eastern Wu. He sent Wang Chang to attack Nan Commandery (\u5357\u90e1; present-day Jingzhou, Hubei), Guanqiu Jian to attack Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day Ezhou, Hubei), and Hu Zun and Zhuge Dan to lead 70,000 troops to attack the Dongxing dam. In response, the Wu general Zhuge Ke led 40,000 troops to Dongxing to counter the invaders. The Battle of Dongxing concluded with a tactical victory for the Wu forces. Zhuge Dan was reassigned to the position of General Who Guards the South (\u93ae\u5357\u5c07\u8ecd) after he returned from the battle. Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin's Rebellion In early 255, the Wei generals Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin started a rebellion in Shouchun (\u58fd\u6625; present-day Shou County, Anhui) because they were unhappy with the Sima family's control over the Wei government. Both of them were close to the former Wei regent Cao Shuang and his followers, who were ousted from power in a coup in 249 by Sima Yi. Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin sent a messenger to Zhuge Dan, urging him to rally troops in Yu Province to support them. However, Zhuge Dan executed the messenger and publicly announced that Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin had rebelled.Sima Shi personally led Wei imperial forces to deal with the rebels. He ordered Zhuge Dan to lead troops from Yu Province and advance to Shouchun via Anfeng Ford (\u5b89\u98a8\u6d25). After Sima Shi quelled the revolt, Zhuge Dan and his forces were the first to enter Shouchun. By then, the civilian population of Shouchun, numbering over 100,000, had fled into the countryside or escaped to Eastern Wu for fear of being killed.The Wei imperial court appointed Zhuge Dan as Senior General Who Guards the East (\u93ae\u6771\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd), with honours equivalent to those of the Three Ducal Ministers, and ordered him to oversee military affairs in Yang Province. Earlier on, when news of Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin's rebellion reached Eastern Wu, the Wu regent Sun Jun, along with L\u00fc Ju, Liu Zan and others, had led Wu forces to Shouchun to support the rebels. However, by the time they showed up, Wei forces had recaptured Shouchun so the Wu forces retreated. Zhuge Dan sent his subordinate Jiang Ban (\u8523\u73ed) to lead troops to attack the retreating Wu forces. Jiang Ban killed Liu Zan in the ensuing battle and obtained his official seal. For his achievements, Zhuge Dan was promoted from a village marquis to a county marquis \u2013 \"Marquis of Gaoping (County)\" (\u9ad8\u5e73\u4faf) \u2013 and awarded 3,500 taxable households to form his marquisate. The Wei government also changed his appointment to \"Senior General Who Attacks the East\" (\u5f81\u6771\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd). Zhuge Dan's Rebellion Making preparations to rebel As Zhuge Dan was close friends with Xiahou Xuan and Deng Yang (\u9127\u98ba) \u2013 both were Cao Shuang's associates \u2013 and had witnessed the downfall of Wang Ling and Guanqiu Jian, he felt very uneasy and was worried that he would become a victim of the Sima family's purges. Thus, when he was stationed in Shouchun (\u58fd\u6625; present-day Shou County, Anhui), he attempted to increase his popularity among the masses in the Huai River area by being very generous. He also used his personal wealth to bribe his subordinates and hire thousands of mercenaries as bodyguards. He even pardoned criminals who committed capital offences.Around the winter of 256, Zhuge Dan found an excuse to entrench himself further in Shouchun and build up his defences. He wrote to the Wei imperial court, claiming that he heard that Eastern Wu forces were planning to attack the Huai River region. He asked for 100,000 troops and permission to build more defensive structures in the area. At the time, as Sima Shi had died in 255, his younger brother Sima Zhao had taken over the reins of power as the regent of Wei. Jia Chong suggested to Sima Zhao to keep a close watch on the generals who were guarding strategic locations throughout the Wei Empire and assess whether they were loyal to him. Sima Zhao heeded his words and sent him to Shouchun to meet Zhuge Dan. Jia Chong told Zhuge Dan, \"Many wise men in Luoyang hope to see the Emperor abdicate in favour of a better ruler. You already know this. What do you think?\" Zhuge Dan replied sternly, \"Aren't you Inspector Jia's son? The State has treated your family generously for generations. How can you betray the State and let it fall into the hands of others? I can't stand this. If there is trouble in Luoyang, I'll die for the State.\" Jia Chong remained silent. After returning to Luoyang, Jia Chong told Sima Zhao, \"Zhuge Dan has high prestige and popularity in Yang Province. If you summon him here and he doesn't obey, it's a small problem. But if you don't summon him, it'll become a big problem.\" Around the early summer of 257, Sima Zhao issued an order in the imperial court's name, ordering Zhuge Dan to return to Luoyang to serve as Minister of Works (\u53f8\u7a7a) in the central government. While the order ostensibly promoted Zhuge Dan to a prestigious ministerial office (one of the Three Ducal Ministers, in fact), it was actually a move to remove him from power in Shouchun and put him under Sima Zhao's control in Luoyang. Rising in revolt When Zhuge Dan received the order, he knew that Sima Zhao was suspicious of him and became fearful. According to the Shiyu, he suspected that Yue Lin (\u6a02\u7d9d), the Inspector (\u523a\u53f2) of Yang Province, had instigated Sima Zhao to remove him from power in Shouchun and summon him to Luoyang. He then led a few hundred soldiers to Yue Lin's office to kill him. When he arrived, he saw that the gates were closed so he shouted at the guards, \"Weren't you my subordinates last time?\" He then forced his way in and killed Yue Lin. Another account from the Wei Mo Zhuan (\u9b4f\u672b\u50b3) mentioned that Zhuge Dan hosted a party after receiving the order and lied that he wanted to take a day off from work and go outside Shouchun. He brought along 700 soldiers with him. When Yue Lin heard about it, he ordered the city gates to be shut. Zhuge Dan then ordered his men to force the gates open, set fire to the Inspector's office, and killed Yue Lin. He then wrote a memorial to the imperial court, accusing Yue Lin of secretly collaborating with Eastern Wu and claiming that he executed Yue Lin after discovering his treachery. The historian Pei Songzhi believed the Wei Mo Zhuan account to be untrue, given how it described Zhuge Dan's behaviour. In any case, Zhuge Dan killed Yue Lin and started a rebellion in Shouchun against the Wei government.When Zhuge Dan rose in revolt, he had about 100,000 troops under his command in the Huai River region. Most of these troops were stationed as part of the Wei government's tuntian policy. He also managed to recruit another 40,000 to 50,000 troops in Yang Province. He had stockpiled a year's worth of supplies and was completely capable of being self-sufficient in that region. He then sent Wu Gang (\u5434\u7db1), a Chief Clerk (\u9577\u53f2), to bring his son Zhuge Jing to seek help from Eastern Wu. In return, Zhuge Jing would remain in Wu as a hostage.The Wu regent Sun Chen was overjoyed. He ordered Quan Yi (\u5168\u61cc), Quan Duan (\u5168\u7aef), Tang Zi, Wang Zuo (\u738b\u795a) and other officers to lead 30,000 Wu troops to support Zhuge Dan's rebellion. He also secretly asked Wen Qin, who had defected to Wu after Guanqiu Jian's defeat, to help Zhuge Dan. The Wu government granted Zhuge Dan imperial authority and the following appointments: Left Protector-General (\u5de6\u90fd\u8b77), Grand Minister Over the Masses (\u5927\u53f8\u5f92), General of Agile Cavalry (\u9a43\u9a0e\u5c07\u8ecd), and Governor of Qing Province (\u9752\u5dde\u7267). They also enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Shouchun (\u58fd\u6625\u4faf). Battles Among the various Wei imperial forces sent to suppress Zhuge Dan's rebellion, the army led by Wang Ji arrived at Shouchun first and started to surround the city. Before the encirclement was complete, the Wu forces led by Tang Zi and Wen Qin managed to cut across mountainous terrain in the northeast of Shouchun and enter the city to meet up with Zhuge Dan.Around July 258, Sima Zhao reached Xiang County (\u9805\u7e23; present-day Shenqiu County, Henan), where he took overall command of the 260,000 troops mobilised from throughout the Wei Empire to suppress the rebellion, and advanced towards Shouchun. He remained at Qiutou (\u4e18\u982d), while sending Wang Ji and Chen Qian (\u9673\u9db1) to surround Shouchun and reinforce their encirclement with defensive structures such as earth walls and moats. At the same time, he also ordered Shi Bao (\u77f3\u82de) and Zhou Tai to lead some troops to patrol the perimeter and guard against any forces coming to help Zhuge Dan. When Wen Qin and others attempted to break out of the siege, they were driven back by the Wei forces.The Wu general Zhu Yi led another force to Shouchun to assist Zhuge Dan. Zhou Tai attacked Zhu Yi at Lijiang (\u9ece\u6f3f) and defeated him. The Wu regent Sun Chen was furious with Zhu Yi's failure and had him executed. Defections After some time, Shouchun gradually ran low on supplies and became increasingly isolated from the outside world. Two of Zhuge Dan's close aides, Jiang Ban (\u8523\u73ed) and Jiao Yi (\u7126\u5f5d), told their general: \"Zhu Yi came with a large army but failed to achieve anything. Sun Chen executed Zhu Yi and returned to Jiangdong. He is actually putting on a front when he sent troops to help us. His decision to turn back already shows that he is adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Now, since our troops are still high on morale and eager to fight, we should focus all efforts on breaking one side of the siege. Even if we cannot drive back the enemy, we can at least allow some of our forces to escape and survive.\"Wen Qin disagreed and told Zhuge Dan, \"Jiangdong forces are known for having scored victories; their enemies in the north can't stop them. Sir, you have led over 100,000 men to join Jiangdong. Quan Yi, myself and the others from Jiangdong are trapped here too with you. Our families are still in Jiangdong. Even if Sun Chen doesn't want to save us, do you think our Emperor and his relatives will abandon us? There were times in the past when our enemy unexpectedly suffered a plague. Now that we have been stuck here for almost a year, if we stir up any feelings of divisiveness, a mutiny might happen. We should continue to hold out and maintain our hopes that help will arrive soon.\"Wen Qin became angry when Jiang Ban and Jiao Yi repeatedly urged Zhuge Dan to follow their plan. Zhuge Dan also became increasingly frustrated with Jiang Ban and Jiao Yi and wanted to execute them. The two of them feared for their lives and realised that Zhuge Dan was destined to fail, so in December 257 or January 258, they escaped from Shouchun and surrendered to Sima Zhao.Sima Zhao later used a ploy to persuade Quan Yi (\u5168\u61cc) and Quan Duan (\u5168\u7aef) to surrender. The Quans fell for the ruse and led a few thousand men with them out of Shouchun to defect to Sima Zhao's side. Their defection caused much fear and panic among Zhuge Dan's forces. Attempting to break the siege In February or March 258, Wen Qin told Zhuge Dan, \"Jiang Ban and Jiao Yi left because we didn't follow their idea to attack the enemy. Quan Duan and Quan Yi have defected too. The enemy must have lowered their guard. Now is the time to attack them.\" Zhuge Dan agreed, so he, Wen Qin and Tang Zi led their troops out to attack and attempt to break out of the siege.Their efforts proved futile because the Wei forces, due to having constructed walls and other defensive structures earlier, were in a more advantageous position over them. The Wei soldiers rained boulders and flaming arrows on Zhuge Dan's forces; thousands were wounded or killed, and the ground was soaked with blood. Unable to break the siege, Zhuge Dan and his forces retreated back to Shouchun, which had run out of food supplies by then. Thousands of Zhuge Dan's men came out of the city and surrendered to Sima Zhao. Downfall and death Earlier on, Wen Qin wanted Zhuge Dan to reduce food rations and send all his men to break the siege, while he and the troops from Eastern Wu would remain behind to guard Shouchun. Zhuge Dan strongly disapproved and quarrelled with Wen Qin over this. Although they initially cooperated, they became more suspicious and distrustful of each other as the situation in Shouchun became more desperate. Zhuge Dan eventually had Wen Qin executed.Upon learning of their father's death at Zhuge Dan's hands, Wen Qin's sons Wen Yang and Wen Hu (\u6587\u864e) attempted to flee from Shouchun. After failing to persuade their men to join them, they escaped on their own and surrendered to Sima Zhao. When an officer advised Sima Zhao to execute them, Sima Zhao said, \"Wen Qin's crimes don't warrant death. Although his sons should be executed, they have surrendered to us. Besides, as the city has yet to be recaptured, executing them will only harden the rebels' resolve.\" He pardoned Wen Yang and Wen Hu, and ordered a few hundred riders to escort them on a tour around Shouchun and announce to the rebels in the city: \"See? Wen Qin's sons have been spared. What's there to be afraid of?\" Sima Zhao later appointed Wen Yang and Wen Hu as military officers and enfeoffed them as secondary marquises.By then, most of Zhuge Dan's men had lost their will to fight after being trapped in the city for months without food. Zhuge Dan, Tang Zi and the remaining officers in Shouchun were also at their wits' end. Sima Zhao came to Shouchun and personally directed his forces to press on the siege and call for battle. The defenders did not respond. Zhuge Dan then attempted to break out of the siege with a few of his subordinates. Hu Fen (\u80e1\u596e), a military officer under Sima Zhao, led his men to attack Zhuge Dan and killed him. Zhuge Dan's decapitated head was put on display and his family members were executed. Zhuge Dan had recruited a few hundred mercenaries as bodyguards. After his death, they were rounded up and each was offered the chance to surrender and be spared, but none accepted and all were executed. The loyalty of these bodyguards towards Zhuge Dan was comparable to the loyalty of the 500 retainers towards Tian Heng (\u7530\u6a6b). Yu Quan (\u4e8e\u8a6e), a Wu officer, said, \"I have received orders from my lord to lead troops to help others. I failed in my mission and can't do anything to defeat the enemy. I won't stand for this.\" He then removed his body armour and charged towards the enemy and was killed. Tang Zi, Wang Zuo (\u738b\u795a) and the other Wu officers surrendered to Sima Zhao. The weapons and equipment captured from the Wu forces formed huge piles like hills. Family Zhuge Dan had at least one son and two daughters. One of Zhuge Dan's daughters married Wang Guang (\u738b\u5ee3), Wang Ling's son. On her wedding night, Wang Ling told her, \"You resemble Gongxiu (Zhuge Dan) so much in your facial expressions!\" She replied, \"You can't be like Yanyun (Wang Ling), so you compare your wife to a hero!\" She was most likely executed along with the rest of the Wang family after Wang Ling's downfall. Zhuge Dan's other daughter married Sima Zhou, Sima Yi's sixth son, who became a prince during the Jin dynasty. She was then known as \"Grand Consort Zhuge\" (\u8af8\u845b\u592a\u5983). She bore Sima Zhou four sons: Sima Jin (\u53f8\u99ac\u89b2), Sima Yao (\u53f8\u99ac\u7e47), Sima Cui (\u53f8\u99ac\u6f3c) and Sima Dan (\u53f8\u99ac\u6fb9). Sima Jin's son Sima Rui became the founding emperor of the Eastern Jin dynasty (317-420), and Zhuge Dan is related to each of the emperors of the Eastern Jin. Zhuge Dan's son, Zhuge Jing, was sent as a hostage to Eastern Wu in 257 in return for support from Wu forces for his father's rebellion. He remained in Wu and served as Minister of War (\u5927\u53f8\u99ac). In 280, after the Jin dynasty conquered Wu, Zhuge Jing went into hiding in the home of his sister (the one who married Sima Zhou). The Jin emperor Sima Yan (Emperor Wu) considered Zhuge Jing his relative (Sima Zhou was an uncle of Emperor Wu) and knew that Zhuge Jing was hiding in his sister's home, so he paid them a visit. When Zhuge Jing heard that the emperor had come to visit him, he hid in the latrine and refused to come out. The emperor insisted on seeing him and said, \"Today, we finally meet each other again.\" Zhuge Jing replied tearfully, \"I regret not being able to cover my body in paint and remove the skin from my face before I meet Your Majesty again!\" Emperor Wu appointed him as a Palace Attendant (\u4f8d\u4e2d), but he refused to accept, returned to his hometown and lived the rest of his life as a commoner. Zhuge Jing had two sons: Zhuge Yi (\u8af8\u845b\u9824) and Zhuge Hui (\u8af8\u845b\u6062). Zhuge Yi served as Minister of Ceremonies (\u592a\u5e38) during the Jin dynasty and was favoured by Emperor Yuan. Zhuge Hui served as Prefect of the Masters of Writing (\u5c1a\u66f8\u4ee4), and had his own biography in the Book of Jin (volume 77). In popular culture Zhuge Dan is first introduced as a playable character in the seventh installment of Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game series.

Lady Niohuru's father, Jiufu, was found guilty of corruption just before her demotion, but official records did not seem to point out any connection between her father's indictment and her demotion.

Musical career Conte proved himself versatile musically, and by 1973, he was playing regularly in local clubs. He quickly became a busy studio musician, and throughout the 1970s, he played in the Latin Jazz band Caldera.In the 1980s, Conte toured with several different musicians, including Madonna, guitarist Al Di Meola, and Andy Narell. His debut as a bandleader came in 1987, when he released La Cocina Caliente, which included a Latinized version of Chopin's \"Susarasa\". Conte also played percussion on the Pat Metheny Group release 'We Live Here', in 1995, on the Pat Metheny 'From This Place', in 2020 as well as I Mother Earth's first two albums Dig (1993) and Scenery and Fish (1996). Conte has toured as part of James Taylor's \"Band of Legends.\" He has also played alongside musicians including Alex Acu\u00f1a, Jaguares, Larry Klimas, and David Garfield, both as a bandleader and a sideman.Luis Conte was part of Phil Collins 1997 \"Dance into the Light\" tour and 2004 \"First Farewell Tour\", performing in both of them Afro-Cuban percussion and adding more depth into the concert songs. He also performed during The Phil Collins Big Band tours in 1996 and 1998 and again during the Phil Collins Not Dead Yet tours 2017\/2018.In 1999 Conte collaborated in Man\u00e1 MTV Unplugged project. In 2009 worked together with Sergio Vall\u00edn in his Bendito Entre Las Mujeres album.

His writings and compositions are amongst the earliest publications of what was then the Cape Colony.  Early years Boniface was born in Paris in 1787, two years before the outbreak of the French Revolution. At the age of twelve he had a grounding in French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Latin, Greek, had written short dramas in the style of Moli\u00e8re, played the guitar and had learned to dance.In 1798 his father, who was a prison governor was banished from France on suspicion of helping Sir Sidney Smith to escape back to England. Smith assisted the Boniface family to settle in the Seychelles, a former French colony which, since the beginning of the French Revolution, was effectively under the control of its own assembly. Boniface enrolled in as a cadet in the Royal Navy. In 1806 Cape Colony passed back into British hands and the following year Boniface made his way there via Mozambique on board a Portuguese slave ship. Cape Town In Cape Town, Boniface learnt German, Dutch and English and set himself up as a language and music teacher, particularly playing the French and Spanish guitars. He was the first person in the Cape Colony known to have noted the local music. In the early nineteenth century the theatre was one of the principal leisure activities in the Cape and Boniface, writing in English, Dutch (with the first words of Afrikaans to appear on the South African stage) and his native French was one of the most popular dramatists in the colony. He wrote a series of plays including L'Enrag\u00e9 (1807) which, in 1823 was translated into Dutch by Joseph Suasso de Lima with the title De Dolzinnige of De Gewaande Dolleman, in 1813 a ballet-pantomime Het beleg en het Nemen van Troyen (The siege and taking of Troy) and in 1826 he translated Moli\u00e8re's Le Bourgeois gentilhomme (The Bourgeois Gentleman) into Dutch under the title De Burger Edelman.In 1828 he became a sworn translator in the Cape Supreme Court.His French-language writings included Relation du naufrage de l'Eole, published in 1829\u2014a record of the journey made by the survivors of the Eole, a French ship that was wrecked off the coast of what was then known as \"British Kaffraria\" en route to R\u00e9union from France earlier that year. He intended to translate it into English under the title Narrative of the Shipwreck of the Eole but never completed his translation though a translation and commentary was published in 2012.In 1830, three years after he had been declared bankrupt following a libel suite, he became the first editor of the Dutch-language newspaper De Zuid-Afrikaan, a post that he held for six months. The Zuid-Afrikaan itself continued for 100 years. While editor he took a pride in stressing the unity between the Dutch and the English cultures.Amongst his notable works with a local flavour was De Nieuwe Ridderorde of De Temperantisten, (The New Knighthood or the Temperance Societies) published in 1832. The play satirised the wave of British puritanism and temperance of the day and in particular John Philip of the London Missionary Society who had secured equality of all free people within the Colony. Although written in Dutch, the local patois (which was later to evolve into Afrikaans) was used by the appropriate characters. This is one of the first pieces of literature in which an Afrikaans-like language appeared.Between 1837 and 1838 Boniface was editor of the bilingual weekly magazine De Meditator published by Cornelius Moll. The magazine, which ceased publication in 1838 when Boniface fell out with Moll, took a sympathetic view towards the Voortrekkers.In 1817 Boniface married Maria Geertruida Heyneman and in the following year their first child Alexis was born. Alexis died in 1828 aged ten and Maria died in 1835 at the age of thirty-nine. Between 1838 and 1843 Boniface had three daughters from a relationship with a freed Mozambique slave Constantia Dorothea le Mordant. Later years in Natal In November 1843 Boniface obtained permission from the Volksraad of the Natalia Republic to establish a newspaper. He left the Cape Colony to avoid a libel suite and moved to Pietermaritzburg. By the time the paper, named De Natalier, was launched on 5 April 1844 the republic had passed into British control and had been renamed the \"Colony of Natal\". De Natalier had a circulation of about forty copies per week and soon succumbed to financial pressure resulting from a libel suite. The gap that it left in the market was taken by The Natal Witness, which was launched by Boniface's former colleague Moll in 1846.His continued association with le Mordant who had followed him to Natal with their three daughters brought contempt from the colonial population. Death On 10 December 1853 while in Durban Boniface committed suicide by taking laudanum. He was 66 years old.

The succession controversy became the pretext of the Decembrist revolt.\nKonstantin was known to eschew court etiquette and to take frequent stands against the wishes of his brother Alexander I, for which he is remembered fondly in Russia, but in his capacity as the governor of Poland he is remembered as a hated ruler.  Early life Konstantin was born in Tsarskoye Selo on 27 April 1779, the second son of the Tsesarevich Paul Petrovich and his wife Maria Fyodorovna, daughter of Friedrich II Eugen, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg. Of all Paul's children, Konstantin most closely resembled his father both physically and mentally.His paternal grandmother Catherine the Great named him after Constantine the Great, the founder of the Eastern Roman Empire. A medal with antique figures was struck to commemorate his birth; it bears the inscription \"Back to Byzantium\" which clearly alludes to Catherine's Greek Plan. According to the British ambassador James Harris, Prince Potemkin's mind is constantly taken up with the idea of creating an empire in the East; he has managed to fascinate the Empress with these feelings, and she proved so subject to his chimeras that she christened the new-born Grand Prince Constantine, gave him as nursemaid a Greek by the name of Helen, and talks in her own circles about how place him on the throne of the Eastern empire. At the same time she is setting up a town at Tsarskoe Selo to be called Konstantingorod. The direction of the boy's upbringing was entirely in the hands of his grandmother, the empress Catherine II. As in the case of her eldest grandson (afterwards the emperor Alexander I), she regulated every detail of his physical and mental education; but in accordance with her usual custom, she left the carrying out of her views to the men who were in her confidence. Count Nikolai Saltykov was supposed to be the actual tutor, but he too in his turn transferred the burden to another, interfering personally only on exceptional occasions, and exercised no influence upon the character of the passionate, restless and headstrong boy. The only person who exerted a responsible influence was Cesar La Harpe, who was tutor-in-chief from 1783 to May 1795 and educated both the empress's grandsons.Catherine arranged Konstantin's marriage as she had Alexander's; Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, 14, and Konstantin, 16, were married on 26 February 1796. As Caroline Bauer recorded in her memoirs, \"The brutal Constantine treated his consort like a slave. So far did he forget all good manners and decency that, in the presence of his rough officers, he made demands on her, as his property, which will hardly bear being hinted of.\" Due to his violent treatment and suffering health problems as a result, Juliane separated from Konstantin in 1799; she eventually settled in Switzerland. An attempt by Konstantin in 1814 to convince her to return broke down in the face of her firm opposition. Napoleonic Wars During this time, Konstantin's first campaign took place under the leadership of Suvorov. The battle of Bassignana was lost by Konstantin's fault; but at Novi he distinguished himself by personal bravery, so that the emperor Paul bestowed on him the title of tsesarevich, which according to the fundamental law of the constitution belonged only to the heir to the throne. Though it cannot be proved that this action of the tsar denoted any far-reaching plan, it yet shows that Paul already distrusted the grand-duke Alexander.Konstantin never tried to secure the throne. After his father's death in 1801, he led a disorderly bachelor life. He abstained from politics, but remained faithful to his military inclinations, without manifesting anything more than a preference for the externalities of the service. In command of the Imperial Guards during the campaign of 1805, he had a share of the responsibility for the Russian defeat at the battle of Austerlitz; while in 1807 neither his skill nor his fortune in war showed any improvement.After the peace of Tilsit he became an ardent admirer of Napoleon and an upholder of the Russo-French alliance. He therefore lost the confidence of his brother Alexander; to the latter, the French alliance was merely a means to an end. This view was not held by Konstantin; even in 1812, after the fall of Moscow, he pressed for a speedy conclusion of peace with Napoleon, and, like field marshal Kutuzov, he too opposed the policy which carried the war across the Russian frontier to victorious conclusion upon French soil. His personal behaviour towards both his own men and French prisoners was eccentric and cruel.During the campaign, Barclay de Tolly was twice obliged to send him away from the army due to his disorderly conduct. His share in the battles in Germany and France was insignificant. At Dresden, on 26 August, his military knowledge failed him at the decisive moment, but at La F\u00e8re-Champenoise he distinguished himself by personal bravery. In Paris the grand duke excited public ridicule by the manifestation of his petty military fads. His first visit was to the stables, and it was said that he had been marching and drilling even in his private rooms. Governor of the Kingdom of Poland Konstantin's importance in political history dates from when his brother, Tsar Alexander, installed him in Congress Poland as de facto viceroy (however, he was not the \"official viceroy\", namestnik of the Kingdom of Poland), with a task of the militarization and discipline of Poland. In Congress Poland, he received the post of commander-in-chief of the forces of the kingdom to which was added in 1819 the command of the Lithuanian troops and of those of the Russian provinces that had belonged to the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (so called Western Krai).Alexander's policies were liberal by the standards of Restoration Europe. Classical liberals lapped up the freedoms of education, scholarship and economic development, but key deficiencies in Poland's autonomy like lack of control over the budget, military, and trade left them hungry for more. The Kalisz Opposition, led by the brothers Bonawentura and Wincenty Niemojowski, pressed for reforms including more independence for the judiciary. Alexander, calling their actions an \"abuse\" of liberty, suspended the Polish parliament (Sejm) for five years and authorised Konstantin to maintain order in the kingdom by any means necessary. Konstantin, attempting to execute his brother's mandate to silence dissent, strengthened the secret police (Ochrana) and suppressed the Polish patriotic movements, leading to further popular discontent. Konstantin also harassed the liberal opposition, replaced Poles with Russians on important posts in local administration and the army and often insulted and assaulted his subordinates, which led to conflicts in the officer corps. The Sejm, until then mostly dominated by supporters of the personal union with Russia, saw his actions as disobedience of the very constitution of which he felt personally proud. That also led to him being mocked, which he did not help by sending his adjutants with threats to those \"guilty\" of it like Wirydianna Fiszerowa. Nevertheless, Konstantin was an ardent supporter of Polish musicians, such as Maria Agata Szymanowska and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin.After 19 years of separation, the marriage of Konstantin and Juliane was formally annulled on 20 March 1820. Two months later, on 27 May, Konstantin married the Polish Countess Joanna Grudzi\u0144ska, who was given the title of Her Serenity Princess of Lowicz. Connected with that, he renounced any claim to the Russian succession, which was formally completed in 1822. After the marriage, he became increasingly attached to his new home of Poland. Succession crisis and Decembrist Uprising When Alexander I died on 1 December 1825, Grand Duke Nicholas had Konstantin proclaimed emperor in Saint Petersburg. In Warsaw meanwhile, Konstantin abdicated the throne. When that became public knowledge, the Northern Society scrambled in secret meetings to convince regimental leaders not to swear allegiance to Nicholas. The efforts would culminate in the Decembrist revolt. Under Nicholas I, Konstantin maintained his position in Poland. Differences soon arose between him and his brother because of the part taken by the Poles in the Decembrist conspiracy. Konstantin hindered the unveiling of the organized plotting for independence, which had been going on in Poland for many years, and held obstinately to the belief that the army and the bureaucracy were loyally devoted to the Russian Empire. The eastern policy of the Tsar and the Turkish War in 1828 to 1829 caused a fresh breach between them. The opposition of Konstantin made the Polish army take no part in the war. Failed assassination and November uprising An assassination attempt was made on the life of Grand Duke Konstantin, which precipitated the November 1830 insurrection in Warsaw (the November Uprising). After the attempt on Konstantin's life, a secret court was set up to prosecute those who were responsible. \"It was learned that Nicholas had ordered the Grand Duke Konstantin ... to start an energetic investigation and court-martial the culprits ... the committee at its session of 27 November decided irrevocably to start the revolution on the evening of the 29th, at 6pm.\" Like the assassination, the recruitment of army units by the rebels failed; only two units joined them, and only the capture of the armory and the subsequent arming of the populace kept the revolt alive. Konstantin saw the revolt as a strictly Polish affair and refused to use troops, as he could have, because it was foolish politically. He could trust his Russian troops, but to use them might be considered a violation of the kingdom's independence and even an act of war. Because of that setback, he was limited to the resources around him. If he decided to intervene, it would require a different source of manpower. He was limited to the handful of Polish troops he could gather together. Constantin thus refused to send his troops against the revolutionaries: \"The Poles have started this disturbance, and it's Poles that must stop it\", and he left the suppression of the revolt in the hands of the Polish government. Polish Prince Ksawery Lubecki, realizing that the insurgents had formed no government by midnight, assembled some members of the council and other prominent personalities on his own initiative. They sent a delegation to the grand duke, but when he stated again that he did not wish to intervene in any way, the committees decided to take matters into their own hands. Konstantin's involvement remained minimal, showing considerable restraint in not wanting to use Russian troops to help put down the rebellion. The timid response that he did give was that he would not attack the city of Warsaw without giving it 48 hours' notice, that he would intercede between the emperor and the Polish Kingdom, and would not order Lithuanian troops to enter Poland. What he was trying to accomplish was to remain neutral at all costs, which led to a belief among his fellow Russians that he was more sensitive towards the Polish independence than to Russian dominance. The securing of neutrality from Konstantin gave the Polish government the feeling that Russia would not attack Poland and gave it the chance effectively to quash the uprising. After ensuring Russian neutrality, Konstantin retreated behind Russian lines. That further confused the Polish government regarding its status with Russia because of a previous Russian promise to help put down the rebellion. The patriotic Poles could not have been more pleased. Konstantin, on 3 December, retreated toward Russia. Following the failure of the uprising, Konstantin expressed admiration for the valor of the Polish insurgents. The policy of neutrality at all costs has led to Konstantin being viewed two ways through the scope of history. Either he would be viewed by the Russian royal family as weak and sympathetic to the Poles, or he would be seen as a seed for the idea of a soon to be independent Poland, but he was effectively only trying to avoid a wider war. Death and legacy Konstantin died of cholera in Vitebsk (now in Belarus) on 27 June 1831 and did not live to see the suppression of the revolution. His frequent stands against the wishes of the Imperial Family were perceived in Russia as brave, even gallant. In Poland, he was viewed as a tyrant, hated by the military and civilian population alike, and in Polish literature, Konstantin is portrayed as a cruel despot. Archives Konstantin's letters to his grandfather, Frederick II Eugene, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, (together with letters from his siblings) written between 1795 and 1797, are preserved in the State Archive of Stuttgart (Hauptstaatsarchiv Stuttgart) in Stuttgart, Germany.

Early life and military career Born on 21 August 1899 in Newport, Wales, the second son of Charles Lyne, Lewis Lyne was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College. Too young to see service during the First World War, Lyne joined the British Army and was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant into the Lancashire Fusiliers on 2 April 1919. After the war he gained a Regular commission on 24 July 1921.

Second World War By the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Lyne was Deputy Assistant Military Secretary at the War Office, and in November, was promoted to acting lieutenant colonel (made temporary in late February) and became Assistant Military Secretary, where he was responsible for the minor details of officer appointments. In August 1940, after the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was evacuated from Dunkirk, Lyne, with a small cadre of Regular soldiers, was appointed Commanding Officer (CO) of the 9th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers in Bury, a war service battalion, composed largely of conscripts. In October the battalion became part of the 208th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), then serving in Scotland under Scottish Command, but in December was transferred to Brigadier The O'Donovan's 125th Infantry Brigade (which also included the 1\/5th and 1\/6th Battalions of the Lancashire Fusiliers), part of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division commanded by Major-General Henry Willcox, which had fought with distinction in France with the BEF, and was now stationed in East Anglia on anti-invasion duties. In late June 1941, after commanding his battalion for over 10 months, he went on to be Chief Instructor at the Senior Officers' School, Sheerness, and was promoted to the local rank of colonel in late July. The school was then focused on preparing relatively junior officers, mainly majors, for the command of battalions and regiments.Promoted to the acting rank of brigadier in March 1942 (and acting colonel on the same date, six months later temporary colonel and temporary brigadier), Lyne was given command of the 169th (London) Infantry Brigade, part of the 56th (London) Infantry Division, then commanded by Major General Eric Miles, who Lyne knew briefly when the latter was General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 42nd Division from late April 1941. The brigade, which Lyne would command for the next two years in several different countries and in some of the most difficult battles of the war, was known as the \"Queen's Brigade\" as it contained three second-line Territorial Army (TA) battalions of the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey). The 169th Brigade had formerly been the 35th Infantry Brigade, part of the 12th (Eastern) Division, which had been severely mauled while serving with the BEF before joining the 56th Division in July 1940, after the 12th Division was broken up, which was then the 1st London Division before being redesignated 56th Division in November, the 35th Brigade becoming the 169th Brigade at the same time. The 169th Brigade was one of three brigades which constituted the 56th Division, the other two being the 167th and 168th, along with supporting divisional troops. The division was then serving in East Anglia, Lyne's brigade stationed in Nacton, Suffolk, and in June orders were received to prepare to mobilise for active service overseas. The Middle East and North Africa The next few weeks for the 56th Division were hectic as it began to mobilise for service overseas, which was completed by late August and the division left England soon after, arriving in Kirkup, Iraq in November 1942. The division formed part of Indian XXI Corps of the Tenth Army, which was given the role of preventing the Germans from reaching the Persian Gulf from the Caucasus. However, the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, the threat receded and the 56th Division could focus its attention on training for offensive operations, and began training in mountain warfare. In March, the division (minus the 168th Brigade) was ordered to join the British Eighth Army, then fighting in the final stages of the Tunisian Campaign. The two brigades of the division then began a 3,200-mile journey from Kirkup to Enfidaville, Tunisia. The journey took four weeks and is the longest approach march in the history of the British Army.Arriving there in late April, Lyne's brigade began to relieve elements of the veteran 2nd New Zealand Division, in contact with the enemy, in the mountains north of Enfidaville on the night of 26 April. Two days later, the X Corps (which the 56th Division formed part of) commander, Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, ordered the brigade to seize Djebel Srafi and Djebel Terhouna. Although the attack began well, a counterattack on the first objective sent men of the 2\/5th Queen's, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Whitfield (who would later be GOC 56th Division), who were there back to their own start lines. However, the Tunisian Campaign itself was finished just over two weeks later, with most of the Allied strength being diverted to the British First Army, advancing on the city of Tunis from the west, soon falling to the Allies on 7 May, and the campaign officially ending on 13 May 1943, with some 238,000 Axis soldiers surrendering. Italy With the campaign over, the division (still minus the 168th Brigade), now commanded by Major-General Douglas Graham after Miles was severely injured on 5 May, was in late May sent to Libya to rest and absorb reinforcements, as well as to train for amphibious operations in preparation for the Allied invasion of Italy. On 3 July Lyne was made a colonel (with seniority dating back to 1 July 1942), on 5 August he was mentioned in dispatches, for his services in Persia and Iraq, and two weeks later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), for his services in the Middle East. The division (now with the 201st Guards Brigade temporarily replacing the 168th) landed on the beaches of Salerno, Italy on 9 September, with Lyne's brigade landing on the 56th Division's left, and aiming for the objective, Montecorvino airfield. The 169th Brigade destroyed thirty-nine aircraft on the ground but, despite support from a squadron of Sherman tanks of the Royal Scots Greys, German resistance was stubborn and they refused to move off the airfield and only fell, almost four days later, after fierce fighting, with heavy losses to all three Queen's battalions. Even then, the brigade was within range of German artillery fire, thus temporarily negating the use of the airfields to the Allies.Over the next few days Lyne's brigade, holding a large sector of the front with too few troops, was reinforced with a company of Royal Engineers, which acted as infantry. With the Germans, who had been concerned mainly with attacking the division's right \u2013 where there had emerged a large gap between the US and British forces \u2013 on the retreat from Salerno on 17 September, due to the situation turning in favour of the Allies, the brigade, along with the rest of the heavily battered 56th Division, spent the next few days in further fighting in an attempt to break through the mountain passes on the path to Naples. On 27 September Lyne's brigade was relieved, in a unique event, by Brigadier \"Bolo\" Whistler's 131st Brigade of the 7th Armoured Division under Major General George Erskine. The 131st Brigade was, like the 169th Brigade, also composed of three TA Queen's battalions and referred to as the Queen's Brigade.The capture of Naples followed days later, with Lieutenant-General Richard McCreery's British X Corps (under which command the 56th Division was serving) advancing on the left of the US Fifth Army, reaching the defensive line on the Volturno river by 9 October. On the day after, the division's GOC, Major-General Graham, was injured and Lyne, the most senior brigade commander, took temporary command of the division for the Volturno crossing. Although the other two X Corps divisions, the 7th Armoured and 46th, the gained a foothold across the river, the 56th Division managed only to gain a weak foothold, which was not exploited. The division had to use the US 3rd Division's crossing point. Around this time the 168th Brigade (which was detached from the division in April) also returned to the 56th Division. On 15 October Major-General Gerald Templer arrived to take command of the division, and Lyne returned to the 169th Brigade.The division's next task was to assault Monte Camino, the last major feature before the Winter Line (or Gustav Line), which failed in mid-November with heavy losses, mainly to the 201st Guards Brigade, with Lyne himself being wounded on 13 November. Returning by early December, the division, with Lyne's brigade playing a major role, was supported by a very heavy artillery barrage and took part in the second attempt to capture Monte Camino, which was taken and the Germans finally thrown off the mountain. On 8 January 1944, however, Lyne returned to hospital and so missed the division's crossing of the Garigliano river during the first Battle of Monte Cassino. He returned again to the brigade on 21 January, as it captured the first peaks of the Aurunci Mountains.After holding their positions gained for the next few weeks, the 56th Division was ordered to the Anzio beachhead in early February, where the Allied forces there were in serious trouble. Northwest Europe In early March the heavily battered 56th Division was relieved by the 5th Division, with Lyne's 169th Brigade being relieved by the 13th Brigade. The intention was to return to Egypt for rest and retraining. Just before the division set sail, however, Lyne, who had been with the division for just over two years and was now an experienced battlefield commander, was ordered to return to England to become GOC of the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, taking over from Major-General William Bradshaw. He was promoted to the acting rank of major-general on 29 March. The division \u2013 comprising the 176th, 177th and 197th Infantry Brigades plus supporting divisional troops \u2013 had been training throughout the United Kingdom since its creation in August 1939 as a second-line duplicate of the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division, but, despite a few of its units having seen action in France in 1940, for the most part the division was completely inexperienced, although very well trained, and had been selected to take part in the Allied invasion of Normandy as part of the 21st Army Group, commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery. The division was serving in Kent as part of XII Corps of the Second Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey.The 59th Division landed in Normandy in late June 1944, almost three weeks after the D-Day landings on 6 June. Soon after arrival the division transferred from XII Corps to Lieutenant-General John Crocker's I Corps and on 8 July, took part in Operation Charnwood, a frontal assault aimed at capturing Caen. Although a D-Day objective for the British 3rd Division, stubborn resistance from the German 21st Panzer Division prevented the division from capturing the city, as had numerous attempts afterwards. Lyne's 59th Division, supported by elements of the 27th Armoured Brigade, and with the British 3rd Division on its left and the 3rd Canadian Division on its right, attacking through La Bijude and Galmanche, were faced by the 12th SS Panzer Division and fierce fighting took place, although by 9 July most of Caen was in Allied hands. The 59th Division, in its first major operation, suffered over 1,200 casualties.The division soon moved back on 11 July to XII Corps, two days later transferring to Lieutenant-General Gerard Bucknall's XXX Corps. In mid-July the division fought in the Second Battle of the Odon, where, it had to capture Noyers and Missy, operating with the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division. The operation, which failed and cost the 59th Division further casualties, was intended to divert German attention away from Operation Goodwood. The division again joined XII Corps and, after the Americans launched Operation Cobra, XXX Corps, now commanded by Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks after Bucknall was sacked, launched Operation Bluecoat and the Germans began withdrawing to Falaise. At the same time, in the first week of August, the 59th Division, with the 56th Independent Brigade temporarily under command and supported by elements of the 34th Tank Brigade, launched an attack over the Orne river and after much hard fighting \u2013 with Captain David Jamieson of the 7th Battalion, Royal Norfolks securing the 59th Division's first and only Victoria Cross (VC) \u2013 secured a bridgehead at Grimbosq, before advancing to Falaise where it held the edge of the \"pocket\". The end of the Normandy Campaign also saw the disbandment of the 59th Division. By this stage of the war, Britain had reached the limits of its manpower, replacements for casualties were severely lacking and some units were broken up and their men posted to other units to fill gaps. With Lyne's 59th Division being the most junior British division in France, it was broken up, although not as a reflection of its performance, with Montgomery, the army group commander and Dempsey, the army commander, both being highly impressed with the division.The division HQ remained in suspended animation until October and Lyne temporarily commanded the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division in place of the GOC, Major-General Douglas Graham, who had been Lyne's superior as GOC 56th Division in Italy. Graham returned in late November, only for the 50th Division to suffer the same fate as the 59th Division, again due to manpower shortages, although the division was reduced to a training reserve formation. On 22 November Lyne was, unusually for an infantryman, selected to become GOC of the veteran 7th Armoured Division, in place of Major-General Gerald Lloyd-Verney who, his superiors believed, had been over-promoted. The division was a much changed formation to the one which had fought in the Western Desert and consisted of the 22nd Armoured and 131st Infantry Brigades, having gone through changes of command. Lyne did not see his first action as an armoured commander until mid-January 1945, when, serving in XII Corps, it fought in Operation Blackcock, the attempt to clear the Roer triangle. The operation was successful, with the division managing to seize its objective, despite the frozen ground, with relatively light casualties. The division remained in its positions until relieved in late February. The division's next assignment was the crossing of the River Rhine into Germany, codenamed Operation Plunder, although the division did not take part in the initial stages, crossing the river on 27 March, three days after the operation began, spearheaded by the 11th Hussars. Two days later Lyne's rank of major general was made temporary. The division, against token resistance, then raced across Germany, capturing thousands of German troops along the way, by 8 April reaching the outskirts of the city of Bremen, which fell to the 3rd Division, and crossed the River Weser a week later. The end of the war in Europe arrived soon after. Lyne took part in the Victory Parade in Berlin on 21 July 1945. He was mentioned in dispatches for his services in Northwest Europe on 7 August. Postwar After the war he became Commandant of the British Sector in Berlin on 6 July 1945, a position he held while still retaining command of the 7th Armoured Division. He was made Director of Staff Duties (DSD) at the War Office in 1946 in 1949; he retired from the army due to ill health in early 1949, aged just 49. Never marrying, he died in Kersey, Suffolk on 4 November 1970. Although he remains largely unknown, Lyne was a highly competent and experienced battlefield commander, gaining respect from both his superiors, most notably Montgomery and Dempsey, and subordinates alike.

History In 1978, Marks began his musical career as a drummer in a heavy metal band. Marks moved to Portugal in 1986 and played Beatles music for tourists. He first delved into electronic music in 1989, when he bought a digital sampler. The first tune he recorded on it was called \"Maxwell House\". Having cut his teeth on the early 1990s ambient dub compilations, in 1994 he released his first studio album Maya on the Planet Dog label, which was submitted to the Mercury Music Prize on its release. It was followed in 1995 by the critically acclaimed Last Train to Lhasa. Both albums reached No. 1 on the UK Indie Chart and featured in the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart. In the following decade, Marks released Live at Glastonbury, Big Men Cry, The Magical Sounds of Banco De Gaia, Igizeh and You Are Here.In 1997, Marks put together a five-piece band that included Ted Duggan (drums), Ashley Hopkins (bass), Larry Whelan (wind synth, saxophone and ethnic flutes), and Gary Spacey-Foot (percussion and saxophones). The band reduced in number to just Marks, Duggan and Hopkins in 1999, and then just Marks and Duggan from 2000 until 2003, when Marks went back to being a solo artist.

Belliard arrived in Atlanta just as the team was emerging as a National League powerhouse. The team made World Series appearances in 1991 and 1992 before finally winning the championship in 1995. Though he had appeared in only 75 games that season, Belliard played shortstop in all six of Atlanta's World Series games.Belliard made his final major-league appearance on April 9, 1998, in a 4\u20133 Braves win over the Pirates. He concluded his playing career with the Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs of the independent Northern League in 1999.Overall during his professional career, Belliard played in 464 minor-league games over seven seasons, batting .247, and played in 1155 major-league games over 17 seasons, batting .221 and hitting only two home runs. Despite being a weak hitter and below-average base stealer, he was an excellent and reliable fielder during his career. Post-playing career After his retirement as a player, Belliard served five seasons in the Braves' minor-league system as a roving fielding instructor. He was named infield coach for the Detroit Tigers on October 11, 2005. He was a uniformed member of Detroit's major league coaching staff through the 2013 season.On December 5, 2019, Belliard was named a special assignment coach for the Kansas City Royals.

In retirement, Ford set aside the enmity he had felt towards Carter following the 1976 election, and the two former presidents developed a close friendship. After experiencing a series of health problems, he died at home on December 26, 2006.  Early life Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. on July 14, 1913, at 3202 Woolworth Avenue in Omaha, Nebraska, where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents. He was the only child of Dorothy Ayer Gardner and Leslie Lynch King Sr., a wool trader. His father was the son of prominent banker Charles Henry King and Martha Alicia King (n\u00e9e Porter). Gardner separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to Oak Park, Illinois, home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James. From there, she moved to the home of her parents, Levi Addison Gardner and Adele Augusta Ayer, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Gardner and King divorced in December 1913, and she gained full custody of her son. Ford's paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930.Ford later said that his biological father had a history of hitting his mother. In a biography of Ford, James M. Cannon wrote that the separation and divorce of Ford's parents was sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King took a butcher knife and threatened to kill his wife, infant son, and Ford's nursemaid. Ford later told confidants that his father had first hit his mother when she had smiled at another man during their honeymoon.After living with her parents for two and a half years, on February 1, 1917, Gardner married Gerald Rudolff Ford, a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company. Though never formally adopted, her young son was referred to as Gerald Rudolff Ford Jr. from then on; the name change was formalized on December 3, 1935. He was raised in Grand Rapids with his three half-brothers from his mother's second marriage: Thomas Gardner \"Tom\" Ford (1918\u20131995), Richard Addison \"Dick\" Ford (1924\u20132015), and James Francis \"Jim\" Ford (1927\u20132001).Ford was involved in the Boy Scouts of America, and earned that program's highest rank, Eagle Scout. He is the only Eagle Scout to have ascended to the U.S. presidency. Ford attended Grand Rapids South High School, where he was a star athlete and captain of the football team. In 1930, he was selected to the All-City team of the Grand Rapids City League. He also attracted the attention of college recruiters. College and law school Ford attended the University of Michigan, where he played center, linebacker, and long snapper for the school's football team and helped the Wolverines to two undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933. In his senior year of 1934, the team suffered a steep decline and won only one game, but Ford was still the team's star player. In one of those games, Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota\u2014the eventual national champion\u2014to a scoreless tie in the first half. After the game, assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan said, \"When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them. Ford and [Cedric] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense.\" Ford later recalled, \"During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds.\" His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, \"They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause.\"During Ford's senior year, a controversy developed when Georgia Tech said that it would not play a scheduled game with Michigan if a black player named Willis Ward took the field. Students, players and alumni protested, but university officials capitulated and kept Ward out of the game. Ford was Ward's best friend on the team, and they roomed together while on road trips. Ford reportedly threatened to quit the team in response to the university's decision, but he eventually agreed to play against Georgia Tech when Ward personally asked him to play.In 1934, Ford was selected for the Eastern Team on the Shriner's East\u2013West Shrine Game at San Francisco (a benefit for physically disabled children), played on January 1, 1935. As part of the 1935 Collegiate All-Star football team, Ford played against the Chicago Bears in the Chicago College All-Star Game at Soldier Field. In honor of his athletic accomplishments and his later political career, the University of Michigan retired Ford's No. 48 jersey in 1994. With the blessing of the Ford family, it was placed back into circulation in 2012 as part of the Michigan Football Legends program and issued to sophomore linebacker Desmond Morgan before a home game against Illinois on October 13.Throughout life, Ford remained interested in his school and football; he occasionally attended games. Ford also visited with players and coaches during practices; at one point, he asked to join the players in the huddle. Before state events, Ford often had the Navy band play the University of Michigan fight song, \"The Victors,\" instead of \"Hail to the Chief.\"Ford graduated from Michigan in 1935 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. He turned down offers from the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers of the National Football League. Instead, he took a job in September 1935 as the boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach at Yale University and applied to its law school.Ford hoped to attend Yale Law School beginning in 1935. Yale officials at first denied his admission to the law school because of his full-time coaching responsibilities. He spent the summer of 1937 as a student at the University of Michigan Law School and was eventually admitted in the spring of 1938 to Yale Law School. That year he was also promoted to the position of junior varsity head football coach at Yale. While at Yale, Ford began working as a model. He initially worked with the John Robert Powers agency before investing in Harry Conover's agency, with whom he modelled until 1941.While attending Yale Law School, Ford joined a group of students led by R. Douglas Stuart Jr., and signed a petition to enforce the 1939 Neutrality Act. The petition was circulated nationally and was the inspiration for the America First Committee, a group determined to keep the U.S. out of World War II. His introduction into politics was in the summer of 1940 when he worked for the Republican presidential campaign of Wendell Willkie.Ford graduated in the top third of his class in 1941, and was admitted to the Michigan bar shortly thereafter. In May 1941, he opened a Grand Rapids law practice with a friend, Philip W. Buchen. U.S. Naval Reserve Following the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, Ford enlisted in the Navy. He received a commission as ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve on April 13, 1942. On April 20, he reported for active duty to the V-5 instructor school at Annapolis, Maryland. After one month of training, he went to Navy Preflight School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he was one of 83 instructors and taught elementary navigation skills, ordnance, gunnery, first aid, and military drill. In addition, he coached all nine sports that were offered, but mostly swimming, boxing, and football. During the year he was at the Preflight School, he was promoted to Lieutenant, Junior Grade, on June 2, 1942, and to lieutenant, in March 1943. Sea duty After Ford applied for sea duty, he was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment for the new aircraft carrier USS Monterey (CVL-26), at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey. From the ship's commissioning on June 17, 1943, until the end of December 1944, Ford served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board the Monterey. While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the Pacific Theater with the Third and Fifth Fleets in late 1943 and 1944. In 1943, the carrier helped secure Makin Island in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against Kavieng, Papua New Guinea in 1943. During the spring of 1944, the Monterey supported landings at Kwajalein and Eniwetok and participated in carrier strikes in the Marianas, Western Carolines, and northern New Guinea, as well as in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. After an overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from the Monterey launched strikes against Wake Island, participated in strikes in the Philippines and Ryukyus, and supported the landings at Leyte and Mindoro.Although the ship was not damaged by the Empire of Japan's forces, the Monterey was one of several ships damaged by Typhoon Cobra that hit Admiral William Halsey's Third Fleet on December 18\u201319, 1944. The Third Fleet lost three destroyers and over 800 men during the typhoon. The Monterey was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's aircraft tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hangar deck. Ford was serving as General Quarters Officer of the Deck and was ordered to go below to assess the raging fire. He did so safely, and reported his findings back to the ship's commanding officer, Captain Stuart H. Ingersoll. The ship's crew was able to contain the fire, and the ship got underway again.After the fire, the Monterey was declared unfit for service. Ford was detached from the ship and sent to the Navy Pre-Flight School at Saint Mary's College of California, where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945. From the end of April 1945 to January 1946, he was on the staff of the Naval Reserve Training Command, Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois, at the rank of lieutenant commander.Ford received the following military awards: the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with nine 3\u204416\" bronze stars (for operations in the Gilbert Islands, Bismarck Archipelago, Marshall Islands, Asiatic and Pacific carrier raids, Hollandia, Marianas, Western Carolines, Western New Guinea, and the Leyte Operation), the Philippine Liberation Medal with two 3\u204416\" bronze stars (for Leyte and Mindoro), and the World War II Victory Medal. He was honorably discharged in February 1946. U.S. House of Representatives (1949\u20131973) After Ford returned to Grand Rapids in 1946, he became active in local Republican politics, and supporters urged him to challenge Bartel J. Jonkman, the incumbent Republican congressman. Military service had changed his view of the world. \"I came back a converted internationalist\", Ford wrote, \"and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated isolationist. And I thought he ought to be replaced. Nobody thought I could win. I ended up winning two to one.\"During his first campaign in 1948, Ford visited voters at their doorsteps and as they left the factories where they worked. Ford also visited local farms where, in one instance, a wager resulted in Ford spending two weeks milking cows following his election victory.Ford was a member of the House of Representatives for 25 years, holding Michigan's 5th congressional district seat from 1949 to 1973. It was a tenure largely notable for its modesty. As an editorial in The New York Times described him, Ford \"saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler, and the record shows it: he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career.\" Appointed to the House Appropriations Committee two years after being elected, he was a prominent member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Ford described his philosophy as \"a moderate in domestic affairs, an internationalist in foreign affairs, and a conservative in fiscal policy.\" He voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Ford was known to his colleagues in the House as a \"Congressman's Congressman\".In the early 1950s, Ford declined offers to run for either the Senate or the Michigan governorship. Rather, his ambition was to become Speaker of the House, which he called \"the ultimate achievement. To sit up there and be the head honcho of 434 other people and have the responsibility, aside from the achievement, of trying to run the greatest legislative body in the history of mankind ... I think I got that ambition within a year or two after I was in the House of Representatives\". Warren Commission On November 29, 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Ford to the Warren Commission, a special task force set up to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. He and Earl Warren also interviewed Jack Ruby, Oswald's killer. According to a 1963 FBI memo that was released to the public in 2008, Ford was in contact with the FBI throughout his time on the Warren Commission and relayed information to the deputy director, Cartha DeLoach, about the panel's activities. In the preface to his book, A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission, Ford defended the work of the commission and reiterated his support of its conclusions. House Minority Leader (1965\u20131973) In 1964, Lyndon Johnson led a landslide victory for his party, secured another term as president and took 36 seats from Republicans in the House of Representatives. Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new minority leader. Three members approached Ford to see if he would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed. After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace Charles Halleck of Indiana as minority leader. The members of the Republican caucus that encouraged and eventually endorsed Ford to run as the House minority leader were later known as the \"Young Turks\" and one of the members of the Young Turks was congressman Donald H. Rumsfeld from Illinois's 13th congressional district, who later on would serve in Ford's administration as the chief of staff and secretary of defense.With a Democratic majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Johnson Administration proposed and passed a series of programs that was called by Johnson the \"Great Society\". During the first session of the Eighty-ninth Congress alone, the Johnson Administration submitted 87 bills to Congress, and Johnson signed 84, or 96%, arguably the most successful legislative agenda in Congressional history.In 1966, criticism over the Johnson Administration's handling of the Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections produced a 47-seat swing in favor of the Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs. Ford's private criticism of the Vietnam War became public knowledge after he spoke from the floor of the House and questioned whether the White House had a clear plan to bring the war to a successful conclusion. The speech angered President Johnson, who accused Ford of having played \"too much football without a helmet\".As minority leader in the House, Ford appeared in a popular series of televised press conferences with Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen, in which they proposed Republican alternatives to Johnson's policies. Many in the press jokingly called this \"The Ev and Jerry Show.\" Johnson said at the time, \"Jerry Ford is so dumb he can't fart and chew gum at the same time.\" The press, used to sanitizing Johnson's salty language, reported this as \"Gerald Ford can't walk and chew gum at the same time.\"After Richard Nixon was elected president in November 1968, Ford's role shifted to being an advocate for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a Revenue Sharing program for state and local governments. Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).During the eight years (1965\u20131973) that Ford served as minority leader, he won many friends in the House because of his fair leadership and inoffensive personality. Vice presidency (1973\u20131974) In his effort to become House Speaker, Ford worked to help Republicans across the country get a majority in the chamber, often traveling on the rubber chicken circuit. After a decade of failing to do so, he promised his wife that he would try again in 1974 then retire in 1976. On October 10, 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned and then pleaded no contest to a single count of tax evasion over his failure to report $29,500 in income received while he was governor of Maryland. According to The New York Times, Nixon \"sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement.\" The advice was unanimous. House Speaker Carl Albert recalled later, \"We gave Nixon no choice but Ford.\" Ford agreed to the nomination, telling his wife that the vice presidency would be \"a nice conclusion\" to his career.Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the 25th Amendment had been implemented. The United States Senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. On December 6, 1973, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. After the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as vice president.Ford became vice president as the Watergate scandal was unfolding. On Thursday, August 1, 1974, Chief of Staff Alexander Haig contacted Ford to tell him to prepare for the presidency. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice president's residence in Washington, D.C. However, \"Al Haig asked to come over and see me\", Ford later said, \"to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.'\" Presidency (1974\u20131977) Swearing-in When Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, Ford automatically assumed the presidency. This made him the only person to become the nation's chief executive without having been previously voted into either the presidential or vice-presidential office by the Electoral College. Immediately after Ford took the oath of office in the East Room of the White House, he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech that was broadcast live to the nation. Ford noted the peculiarity of his position: \"I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers.\" He went on to state: I have not sought this enormous responsibility, but I will not shirk it. Those who nominated and confirmed me as Vice President were my friends and are my friends. They were of both parties, elected by all the people and acting under the Constitution in their name. It is only fitting then that I should pledge to them and to you that I will be the President of all the people. He also stated: My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over. Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here, the people rule. But there is a higher Power, by whatever name we honor Him, who ordains not only righteousness but love, not only justice, but mercy. ... let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and hate. A portion of the speech would later be memorialized with a plaque at the entrance to his presidential museum. On August 20, Ford nominated former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to fill the vice presidency he had vacated. Rockefeller's top competitor had been George H. W. Bush. Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress, which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides, such as Henry Kissinger. Although conservative Republicans were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked, most of them voted for his confirmation, and his nomination passed both the House and Senate. Some, including Barry Goldwater, voted against him. Pardon of Nixon On September 8, 1974, Ford issued Proclamation 4311, which gave Nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he might have committed against the United States while president. In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country, and that the Nixon family's situation \"is a tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must.\"Ford's decision to pardon Nixon was highly controversial. Critics derided the move and said a \"corrupt bargain\" had been struck between the two men, in which Ford's pardon was granted in exchange for Nixon's resignation, elevating Ford to the presidency. Ford's first press secretary and close friend Jerald terHorst resigned his post in protest after the pardon. According to Bob Woodward, Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig proposed a pardon deal to Ford. He later decided to pardon Nixon for other reasons, primarily the friendship he and Nixon shared. Regardless, historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons Ford lost the 1976 presidential election, an observation with which Ford agreed. In an editorial at the time, The New York Times stated that the Nixon pardon was a \"profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act\" that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's \"credibility as a man of judgment, candor and competence\". On October 17, 1974, Ford testified before Congress on the pardon. He was the first sitting president since Abraham Lincoln to testify before the House of Representatives.In the months following the pardon, Ford often declined to mention President Nixon by name, referring to him in public as \"my predecessor\" or \"the former president.\" When Ford was pressed on the matter on a 1974 trip to California, White House correspondent Fred Barnes recalled that he replied \"I just can't bring myself to do it.\"After Ford left the White House in January 1977, he privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proven Ford to have made the correct decision. Draft dodgers and deserters On September 16 (shortly after he pardoned Nixon), Ford issued Presidential Proclamation 4313, which introduced a conditional amnesty program for military deserters and Vietnam War draft dodgers who had fled to countries such as Canada. The conditions of the amnesty required that those reaffirm their allegiance to the United States and serve two years working in a public service job or a total of two years service for those who had served less than two years of honorable service in the military. The program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters established a Clemency Board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a Presidential Pardon and a change in Military discharge status. Full pardon for draft dodgers came in the Carter administration. Administration When Ford assumed office, he inherited Nixon's Cabinet. During his brief administration, he replaced all members except Secretary of State Kissinger and Secretary of the Treasury William E. Simon. Political commentators have referred to Ford's dramatic reorganization of his Cabinet in the fall of 1975 as the \"Halloween Massacre\". One of Ford's appointees, William Coleman\u2014the Secretary of Transportation\u2014was the second black man to serve in a presidential cabinet (after Robert C. Weaver) and the first appointed in a Republican administration.Ford selected George H. W. Bush as Chief of the US Liaison Office to the People's Republic of China in 1974, and then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency in late 1975.Ford's transition chairman and first Chief of Staff was former congressman and ambassador Donald Rumsfeld. In 1975, Rumsfeld was named by Ford as the youngest-ever Secretary of Defense. Ford chose a young Wyoming politician, Richard Cheney, to replace Rumsfeld as his new Chief of Staff; Cheney became the campaign manager for Ford's 1976 presidential campaign. Midterm elections The 1974 Congressional midterm elections took place in the wake of the Watergate scandal and less than three months after Ford assumed office. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the House elections, taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was one more than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, the number necessary to override a Presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment. Perhaps due in part to this fact, the 94th Congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since Andrew Johnson was President of the United States (1865\u20131869). Even Ford's former, reliably Republican House seat was won by a Democrat, Richard Vander Veen, who defeated Robert VanderLaan. In the Senate elections, the Democratic majority became 61 in the 100-seat body. Domestic policy Inflation The economy was a great concern during the Ford administration. One of the first acts the new president took to deal with the economy was to create, by Executive Order on September 30, 1974, the Economic Policy Board. In October 1974, in response to rising inflation, Ford went before the American public and asked them to \"Whip Inflation Now\". As part of this program, he urged people to wear \"WIN\" buttons. At the time, inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy, more so than growing unemployment; there was a belief that controlling inflation would help reduce unemployment. To rein in inflation, it was necessary to control the public's spending. To try to mesh service and sacrifice, \"WIN\" called for Americans to reduce their spending and consumption. On October 4, 1974, Ford gave a speech in front of a joint session of Congress; as a part of this speech he kicked off the \"WIN\" campaign. Over the next nine days, 101,240 Americans mailed in \"WIN\" pledges. In hindsight, this was viewed as simply a public relations gimmick which had no way of solving the underlying problems. The main point of that speech was to introduce to Congress a one-year, five-percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals. This plan would also take $4.4 billion out of the budget, bringing federal spending below $300 billion. At the time, inflation was over twelve percent. Budget The federal budget ran a deficit every year Ford was president. Despite his reservations about how the program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight public budgeting, Ford signed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, which established special education throughout the United States. Ford expressed \"strong support for full educational opportunities for our handicapped children\" according to the official White House press release for the bill signing.The economic focus began to change as the country sank into the worst recession since the Great Depression four decades earlier. The focus of the Ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment, which reached nine percent in May 1975. In January 1975, Ford proposed a 1-year tax reduction of $16 billion to stimulate economic growth, along with spending cuts to avoid inflation. Ford was criticized for abruptly switching from advocating a tax increase to a tax reduction. In Congress, the proposed amount of the tax reduction increased to $22.8 billion in tax cuts and lacked spending cuts. In March 1975, Congress passed, and Ford signed into law, these income tax rebates as part of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975. This resulted in a federal deficit of around $53 billion for the 1975 fiscal year and $73.7 billion for 1976.When New York City faced bankruptcy in 1975, Mayor Abraham Beame was unsuccessful in obtaining Ford's support for a federal bailout. The incident prompted the New York Daily News' famous headline \"Ford to City: Drop Dead\", referring to a speech in which \"Ford declared flatly ... that he would veto any bill calling for 'a federal bail-out of New York City'\". Swine flu Ford was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic. In the early 1970s, an influenza strain H1N1 shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans. On February 5, 1976, an army recruit at Fort Dix mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized; health officials announced that \"swine flu\" was the cause. Soon after, public health officials in the Ford administration urged that every person in the United States be vaccinated. Although the vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems, some 25% of the population was vaccinated by the time the program was canceled in December 1976. Equal rights and abortion Ford was an outspoken supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment, issuing Presidential Proclamation no. 4383 in 1975: In this Land of the Free, it is right, and by nature it ought to be, that all men and all women are equal before the law. Now, therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States of America, to remind all Americans that it is fitting and just to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment adopted by the Congress of the United States of America, in order to secure legal equality for all women and men, do hereby designate and proclaim August 26, 1975, as Women's Equality Day. As president, Ford's position on abortion was that he supported \"a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the 50 States to make the choice\". This had also been his position as House Minority Leader in response to the 1973 Supreme Court case of Roe v. Wade, which he opposed. Ford came under criticism when First Lady Betty Ford entered the debate over abortion during an August 1975 interview for 60 Minutes, in which she stated that Roe v. Wade was a \"great, great decision\". During his later life, Ford would identify as pro-choice. Foreign policy Ford continued the d\u00e9tente policy with both the Soviet Union and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War. Still in place from the Nixon administration was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China was reinforced by Ford's own visit in December 1975. The Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords with the Soviet Union in 1975, creating the framework of the Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance which later evolved into Human Rights Watch.Ford attended the inaugural meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations (initially the G5) in 1975 and secured membership for Canada. Ford supported international solutions to issues. \"We live in an interdependent world and, therefore, must work together to resolve common economic problems,\" he said in a 1974 speech.In November 1975, Ford adopted the global human population control recommendations of National Security Study Memorandum 200 \u2013 a national security directive initially commissioned by Nixon \u2013 as United States policy in the subsequent NSDM 314. The plan explicitly states the goal was population control and not improving the lives of individuals despite instructing organizers to \"emphasize development and improvements in the quality of life of the poor\", later explaining the projects were \"primarily for other reasons\". Upon approving the plan, Ford stated \"United States leadership is essential to combat population growth, to implement the World Population Plan of Action and to advance United States security and overseas interests\". Population control policies were adopted to protect American economic and military interests, with the memorandum arguing that population growth in developing countries resulted with such nations gaining global political power, that more citizens posed a risk to accessing foreign natural resources while also making American businesses vulnerable to governments seeking to fund a growing population, and that younger generations born would be prone to anti-establishment behavior, increasing political instability. Middle East In the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, two ongoing international disputes developed into crises. The Cyprus dispute turned into a crisis with the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in July 1974, causing extreme strain within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance. In mid-August, the Greek government withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both the effect of this on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill. A second bill was then passed by Congress, which Ford also vetoed, fearing that it might impede negotiations in Cyprus, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until December 10, 1974, provided Turkey would not send American supplies to Cyprus. U.S. military aid to Turkey was suspended on February 5, 1975. In the continuing Arab\u2013Israeli conflict, although the initial cease fire had been implemented to end active conflict in the Yom Kippur War, Kissinger's continuing shuttle diplomacy was showing little progress. Ford considered it \"stalling\" and wrote, \"Their [Israeli] tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell.\" During Kissinger's shuttle to Israel in early March 1975, a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal, prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, which included: I wish to express my profound disappointment over Israel's attitude in the course of the negotiations ... Failure of the negotiation will have a far reaching impact on the region and on our relations. I have given instructions for a reassessment of United States policy in the region, including our relations with Israel, with the aim of ensuring that overall American interests ... are protected. You will be notified of our decision. On March 24, Ford informed congressional leaders of both parties of the reassessment of the administration's policies in the Middle East. In practical terms, \"reassessment\" meant canceling or suspending further aid to Israel. For six months between March and September 1975, the United States refused to conclude any new arms agreements with Israel. Rabin notes it was \"an innocent-sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in American-Israeli relations\". The announced reassessments upset the American Jewish community and Israel's well-wishers in Congress. On May 21, Ford \"experienced a real shock\" when seventy-six U.S. senators wrote him a letter urging him to be \"responsive\" to Israel's request for $2.59 billion (equivalent to $13.04 billion in 2021) in military and economic aid. Ford felt truly annoyed and thought the chance for peace was jeopardized. It was, since the September 1974 ban on arms sales to Turkey, the second major congressional intrusion upon the President's foreign policy prerogatives. The following summer months were described by Ford as an American-Israeli \"war of nerves\" or \"test of wills\". After much bargaining, the Sinai Interim Agreement (Sinai II) was formally signed on September 1, and aid resumed. Vietnam One of Ford's greatest challenges was dealing with the continuing Vietnam War. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease-fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American prisoners of war. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the Geneva Conference of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.The agreements were negotiated by US National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and North Vietnamese Politburo member L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd. South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu was not involved in the final negotiations, and publicly criticized the proposed agreement. However, anti-war pressures within the United States forced Nixon and Kissinger to pressure Thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of American forces. In multiple letters to the South Vietnamese president, Nixon had promised that the United States would defend Thieu's government, should the North Vietnamese violate the accords.In December 1974, months after Ford took office, North Vietnamese forces invaded the province of Phuoc Long. General Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Tr\u00e0 sought to gauge any South Vietnamese or American response to the invasion, as well as to solve logistical issues, before proceeding with the invasion.As North Vietnamese forces advanced, Ford requested Congress approve a $722 million aid package for South Vietnam, funds that had been promised by the Nixon administration. Congress voted against the proposal by a wide margin. Senator Jacob K. Javits offered \"...large sums for evacuation, but not one nickel for military aid\". President Thieu resigned on April 21, 1975, publicly blaming the lack of support from the United States for the fall of his country. Two days later, on April 23, Ford gave a speech at Tulane University. In that speech, he announced that the Vietnam War was over \"...as far as America is concerned\". The announcement was met with thunderous applause.1,373 U.S. citizens and 5,595 Vietnamese and third-country nationals were evacuated from the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon during Operation Frequent Wind. Many of the Vietnamese evacuees were allowed to enter the United States under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act. The 1975 Act appropriated $455 million toward the costs of assisting the settlement of Indochinese refugees. In all, 130,000 Vietnamese refugees came to the United States in 1975. Thousands more escaped in the years that followed. Mayaguez incident North Vietnam's victory over the South led to a considerable shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S. influence there. The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region when Khmer Rouge forces seized an American ship in international waters. The main crisis was the Mayaguez incident. In May 1975, shortly after the fall of Saigon and the Khmer Rouge conquest of Cambodia, Cambodians seized the American merchant ship Mayaguez in international waters. Ford dispatched Marines to rescue the crew, but the Marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as, unknown to the U.S., the Mayaguez sailors were being released. In the operation, two military transport helicopters carrying the Marines for the assault operation were shot down, and 41 U.S. servicemen were killed and 50 wounded, while approximately 60 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed. Despite the American losses, the operation was seen as a success in the United States, and Ford enjoyed an 11-point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath. The Americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall in Washington, D.C. Some historians have argued that the Ford administration felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot. But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia. Assassination attempts Ford was the target of two assassination attempts during his presidency. In Sacramento, California, on September 5, 1975, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, pointed a Colt .45-caliber handgun at Ford and pulled the trigger at point-blank range. As she did, Larry Buendorf, a Secret Service agent, grabbed the gun, and Fromme was taken into custody. She was later convicted of attempted assassination of the President and was sentenced to life in prison; she was paroled on August 14, 2009, after serving 34 years.In reaction to this attempt, the Secret Service began keeping Ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds, a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later. As he left the St. Francis Hotel in downtown San Francisco, Sara Jane Moore, standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street, fired a .38-caliber revolver at him. The shot missed Ford by a few feet. Before she fired a second round, retired Marine Oliver Sipple grabbed at the gun and deflected her shot; the bullet struck a wall about six inches above and to the right of Ford's head, then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver, who was slightly wounded. Moore was later sentenced to life in prison. She was paroled on December 31, 2007, after serving 32 years. Judicial appointments Supreme Court In 1975, Ford appointed John Paul Stevens as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States to replace retiring Justice William O. Douglas. Stevens had been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, appointed by President Nixon. During his tenure as House Republican leader, Ford had led efforts to have Douglas impeached. After being confirmed, Stevens eventually disappointed some conservatives by siding with the Court's liberal wing regarding the outcome of many key issues. Nevertheless, in 2005 Ford praised Stevens. \"He has served his nation well,\" Ford said of Stevens, \"with dignity, intellect and without partisan political concerns.\" Other judicial appointments Ford appointed 11 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 50 judges to the United States district courts. 1976 presidential election Ford reluctantly agreed to run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.In addition to the pardon dispute and lingering anti-Republican sentiment, Ford had to counter a plethora of negative media imagery. Chevy Chase often did pratfalls on Saturday Night Live, imitating Ford, who had been seen stumbling on two occasions during his term. As Chase commented, \"He even mentioned in his own autobiography it had an effect over a period of time that affected the election to some degree.\"Ford's 1976 election campaign benefitted from his being an incumbent president during several anniversary events held during the period leading up to the United States Bicentennial. The Washington, D.C. fireworks display on the Fourth of July was presided over by the President and televised nationally. On July 7, 1976, the President and First Lady served as hosts at a White House state dinner for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip of the United Kingdom, which was televised on the Public Broadcasting Service network. The 200th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts gave Ford the opportunity to deliver a speech to 110,000 in Concord acknowledging the need for a strong national defense tempered with a plea for \"reconciliation, not recrimination\" and \"reconstruction, not rancor\" between the United States and those who would pose \"threats to peace\". Speaking in New Hampshire on the previous day, Ford condemned the growing trend toward big government bureaucracy and argued for a return to \"basic American virtues\". Televised presidential debates were reintroduced for the first time since the 1960 election. As such, Ford became the first incumbent president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they \"gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer\". The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration.\" Ford also said that he did not \"believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union\". In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the spirits of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner Max Frankel was visibly incredulous at the response. In the end, Carter won the election, receiving 50.1% of the popular vote and 297 electoral votes compared with 48.0% and 240 electoral votes for Ford. Post-presidency (1977\u20132006) The Nixon pardon controversy eventually subsided. Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, opened his 1977 inaugural address by praising the outgoing president, saying, \"For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.\"After leaving the White House, the Fords moved to Denver, Colorado. Ford successfully invested in oil with Marvin Davis, which later provided an income for Ford's children.He continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In January 1977, he became the president of Eisenhower Fellowships in Philadelphia, then served as the chairman of its board of trustees from 1980 to 1986. Later in 1977, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M. Naughton, a New York Times journalist who was given the assignment to write the former president's advance obituary, an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication. In 1979, Ford published his autobiography, A Time to Heal (Harper\/Reader's Digest, 454 pages). A review in Foreign Affairs described it as, \"Serene, unruffled, unpretentious, like the author. This is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs, but there are no surprises, no deep probings of motives or events. No more here than meets the eye.\"During the term of office of his successor, Jimmy Carter, Ford received monthly briefs by President Carter's senior staff on international and domestic issues, and was always invited to lunch at the White House whenever he was in Washington, D.C. Their close friendship developed after Carter had left office, with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of Anwar el-Sadat in 1981. Until Ford's death, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, visited the Fords' home frequently. Ford and Carter served as honorary co-chairs of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2001 and of the Continuity of Government Commission in 2002. Like Presidents Carter, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, Ford was an honorary co-chair of the Council for Excellence in Government, a group dedicated to excellence in government performance, which provides leadership training to top federal employees. He also devoted much time to his love of golf, often playing both privately and in public events with comedian Bob Hope, a longtime friend. In 1977, he shot a hole in one during a Pro-am held in conjunction with the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic at Colonial Country Club in Memphis, Tennessee. He hosted the Jerry Ford Invitational in Vail, Colorado from 1977 to 1996.In 1977, Ford established the Gerald R. Ford Institute of Public Policy at Albion College in Albion, Michigan, to give undergraduates training in public policy. In April 1981, he opened the Gerald R. Ford Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on the north campus of his alma mater, the University of Michigan, followed in September by the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids.Ford considered a run for the Republican nomination in 1980, forgoing numerous opportunities to serve on corporate boards to keep his options open for a rematch with Carter. Ford attacked Carter's conduct of the SALT II negotiations and foreign policy in the Middle East and Africa. Many have argued that Ford also wanted to exorcise his image as an \"Accidental President\" and to win a term in his own right. Ford also believed the more conservative Ronald Reagan would be unable to defeat Carter and would hand the incumbent a second term. Ford was encouraged by his former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger as well as Jim Rhodes of Ohio and Bill Clements of Texas to make the race. On March 15, 1980, Ford announced that he would forgo a run for the Republican nomination, vowing to support the eventual nominee. After securing the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford as a potential vice-presidential running mate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the Republican National Convention were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented \"co-presidency\", giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and Alan Greenspan as Treasury Secretary). After rejecting these terms, Reagan offered the vice-presidential nomination instead to George H. W. Bush. Ford did appear in a campaign commercial for the Reagan-Bush ticket, in which he declared that the country would be \"better served by a Reagan presidency rather than a continuation of the weak and politically expedient policies of Jimmy Carter\". On October 8, 1980, Ford said former President Nixon's involvement in the general election potentially could negatively impact the Reagan campaign: \"I think it would have been much more helpful if Mr. Nixon had stayed in the background during this campaign. It would have been much more beneficial to Ronald Reagan.\"On October 3, 1980, Ford cast blame on Carter for the latter's charges of ineffectiveness on the part of the Federal Reserve Board due to his appointing of most of its members: \"President Carter, when the going gets tough, will do anything to save his own political skin. This latest action by the president is cowardly.\"Following the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, Ford told reporters while appearing at a fundraiser for Thomas Kean that criminals who use firearms should get the death penalty in the event someone is injured with the weapon.In September 1981, Ford advised Reagan against succumbing to Wall Street demands and follow his own agenda for the economic policies of the US during an appearance on Good Morning America: \"He shouldn't let the gurus of Wall Street decide what the economic future of this country is going to be. They are wrong in my opinion.\" On October 20, 1981, Ford stated stopping the Reagan administration's Saudi arms package could have a large negative impact to American relations in the Middle East during a news conference.On March 24, 1982, Ford offered an endorsement of President Reagan's economic policies while also stating the possibility of Reagan being met with a stalemate by Congress if not willing to compromise while in Washington.Ford founded the annual AEI World Forum in 1982, and joined the American Enterprise Institute as a distinguished fellow. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate at Central Connecticut State University on March 23, 1988. During an August 1982 fundraising reception, Ford stated his opposition to a constitutional amendment requiring the US to have a balanced budget, citing a need to elect \"members of the House and Senate who will immediately when Congress convenes act more responsibly in fiscal matters.\" Ford was a participant in the 1982 midterm elections, traveling to Tennessee in October of that year to help Republican candidates.In January 1984, a letter signed by Ford and Carter and urging world leaders to extend their failed effort to end world hunger was released and sent to Secretary-General of the United Nations Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar.In 1987, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of District of Columbia Circuit Court judge and former Solicitor General Robert Bork after Bork was nominated by President Reagan to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Bork's nomination was rejected by a vote of 58\u201342.In 1987, Ford's Humor and the Presidency, a book of humorous political anecdotes, was published. By 1988, Ford was a member of several corporate boards including Commercial Credit, Nova Pharmaceutical, The Pullman Company, Tesoro Petroleum, and Tiger International, Inc. Ford also became an honorary director of Citigroup, a position he held until his death.In October 1990, Ford appeared in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania with Bob Hope to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the birth of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, where the two unveiled a plaque with the signatures of each living former president.In April 1991, Ford joined former presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and Jimmy Carter, in supporting the Brady Bill. Three years later, he wrote to the U.S. House of Representatives, along with Carter and Reagan, in support of the assault weapons ban.At the 1992 Republican National Convention, Ford compared the election cycle to his 1976 loss to Carter and urged attention be paid to electing a Republican Congress: \"If it's change you want on Nov. 3, my friends, the place to start is not at the White House but in the United States' Capitol. Congress, as every school child knows, has the power of the purse. For nearly 40 years, Democratic majorities have held to the time-tested New Deal formula, tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect.\" (The Republicans would later win both Houses of Congress at the 1994 mid-term elections.) In April 1997, Ford joined President Bill Clinton, former President Bush, and Nancy Reagan in signing the \"Summit Declaration of Commitment\" in advocating for participation by private citizens in solving domestic issues within the United States.On January 20, 1998, during an interview at his Palm Springs home, Ford said the Republican Party's nominee in the 2000 presidential election would lose if the party turned ultra-conservative in their ideals: \"If we get way over on the hard right of the political spectrum, we will not elect a Republican President. I worry about the party going down this ultra-conservative line. We ought to learn from the Democrats: when they were running ultra-liberal candidates, they didn't win.\"In the prelude to the impeachment of President Clinton, Ford conferred with former President Carter and the two agreed to not speak publicly on the controversy, a pact broken by Carter when answering a question from a student at Emory University.In October 2001, Ford broke with conservative members of the Republican Party by stating that gay and lesbian couples \"ought to be treated equally. Period.\" He became the highest-ranking Republican to embrace full equality for gays and lesbians, stating his belief that there should be a federal amendment outlawing anti-gay job discrimination and expressing his hope that the Republican Party would reach out to gay and lesbian voters. He also was a member of the Republican Unity Coalition, which The New York Times described as \"a group of prominent Republicans, including former President Gerald R. Ford, dedicated to making sexual orientation a non-issue in the Republican Party\".On November 22, 2004, New York Republican Governor George Pataki named Ford and the other living former Presidents (Carter, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) as honorary members of the board rebuilding the World Trade Center. In a pre-recorded embargoed interview with Bob Woodward of The Washington Post in July 2004, Ford stated that he disagreed \"very strongly\" with the Bush administration's choice of Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction as justification for its decision to invade Iraq, calling it a \"big mistake\" unrelated to the national security of the United States and indicating that he would not have gone to war had he been president. The details of the interview were not released until after Ford's death, as he requested. Health problems On April 4, 1990, Ford was admitted to Eisenhower Medical Center for surgery to replace his left knee, orthopedic surgeon Dr. Robert Murphy saying, \"Ford's entire left knee was replaced with an artificial joint, including portions of the adjacent femur, or thigh bone, and tibia, or leg bone.\"Ford suffered two minor strokes at the 2000 Republican National Convention, but made a quick recovery after being admitted to Hahnemann University Hospital. In January 2006, he spent 11 days at the Eisenhower Medical Center near his residence at Rancho Mirage, California, for treatment of pneumonia. On April 23, 2006, President George W. Bush visited Ford at his home in Rancho Mirage for a little over an hour. This was Ford's last public appearance and produced the last known public photos, video footage, and voice recording. While vacationing in Vail, Colorado, Ford was hospitalized for two days in July 2006 for shortness of breath. On August 15 he was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for testing and evaluation. On August 21, it was reported that he had been fitted with a pacemaker. On August 25, he underwent an angioplasty procedure at the Mayo Clinic. On August 28, Ford was released from the hospital and returned with his wife Betty to their California home. On October 13, he was scheduled to attend the dedication of a building of his namesake, the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, but due to poor health and on the advice of his doctors he did not attend. The previous day, Ford had entered the Eisenhower Medical Center for undisclosed tests; he was released on October 16. By November 2006, he was confined to a bed in his study. Death and legacy Ford died on December 26, 2006, at his home in Rancho Mirage, California, of arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease and diffuse arteriosclerosis. He had end-stage coronary artery disease and severe aortic stenosis and insufficiency, caused by calcific alteration of one of his heart valves. At the time of his death, Ford was the longest-lived U.S. president, having lived 93 years and 165 days (45 days longer than Ronald Reagan, whose record he surpassed). He died on the 34th anniversary of President Harry S. Truman's death; he was the last surviving member of the Warren Commission.On December 30, 2006, Ford became the 11th U.S. president to lie in state in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. A state funeral and memorial services were held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, January 2, 2007. After the service, Ford was interred at his Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan.Scouting was so important to Ford that his family asked for Scouts to participate in his funeral. A few selected Scouts served as ushers inside the National Cathedral. About 400 Eagle Scouts were part of the funeral procession, where they formed an honor guard as the casket went by in front of the museum.Ford selected the song to be played during his funeral procession at the U.S. Capitol. After his death in December 2006, the University of Michigan Marching Band played the school's fight song for him one final time, for his last ride from the Gerald R. Ford Airport in Grand Rapids, Michigan.The State of Michigan commissioned and submitted a statue of Ford to the National Statuary Hall Collection, replacing Zachariah Chandler. It was unveiled on May 3, 2011, in the Capitol Rotunda. On the proper right side is inscribed a quotation from a tribute by Tip O'Neill, Speaker of the House at the end of Ford's presidency: \"God has been good to America, especially during difficult times. At the time of the Civil War, he gave us Abraham Lincoln. And at the time of Watergate, he gave us Gerald Ford\u2014the right man at the right time who was able to put our nation back together again.\" On the proper left side are words from Ford's swearing-in address: \"Our constitution works. Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule.\" Ford's wife, Betty Ford, died on July 8, 2011. Personal life Family When speaking of his mother and stepfather, Ford said that \"My stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful. So I couldn't have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing.\"Ford had three half-siblings from the second marriage of Leslie King Sr., his biological father: Marjorie King (1921\u20131993), Leslie Henry King (1923\u20131976), and Patricia Jane King (1925\u20131980). They never saw one another as children, and he did not know them at all until 1960. Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17, when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth. That year his biological father, whom Ford described as a \"carefree, well-to-do man who didn't really give a damn about the hopes and dreams of his firstborn son\", approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant. The two \"maintained a sporadic contact\" until Leslie King Sr.'s death in 1941. On October 15, 1948, Ford married Elizabeth Bloomer (1918\u20132011) at Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids; it was his first and only marriage and her second marriage. She had previously been married and, after a five\u2010year marriage, divorced from William Warren.Originally from Grand Rapids herself, she had lived in New York City for several years, where she worked as a John Robert Powers fashion model and a dancer in the auxiliary troupe of the Martha Graham Dance Company. At the time of their engagement, Ford was campaigning for what would be his first of 13 terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives. The wedding was delayed until shortly before the election because, as The New York Times reported in a 1974 profile of Betty Ford, \"Jerry Ford was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced exdancer.\"The couple had four children: Michael Gerald, born in 1950, John Gardner (known as Jack) born in 1952, Steven Meigs, born in 1956, and Susan Elizabeth, born in 1957. Civic and fraternal organizations Ford was a member of several civic and fraternal organizations, including the Junior Chamber of Commerce (Jaycees), American Legion, AMVETS, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Sons of the Revolution, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and was an alumnus of Delta Kappa Epsilon at Michigan. Freemasonry Ford was initiated into Freemasonry on September 30, 1949. He later said in 1975, \"When I took my obligation as a master mason\u2014incidentally, with my three younger brothers\u2014I recalled the value my own father attached to that order. But I had no idea that I would ever be added to the company of the Father of our Country and 12 other members of the order who also served as Presidents of the United States.\" Ford was made a 33\u00b0 Scottish Rite Mason on September 26, 1962. In April 1975, Ford was elected by a unanimous vote Honorary Grand Master of the International Supreme Council, Order of DeMolay, a position in which he served until January 1977. Ford received the degrees of York Rite Masonry (Chapter and Council degrees) in a special ceremony in the Oval Office on January 11, 1977, during his term as President of the United States.Ford was also a member of the Shriners and the Royal Order of Jesters; both being affiliated bodies of Freemasonry. Public image Ford is the only person to hold the presidential office without being elected as either president or vice president. The choice of Ford to fill the vacant vice-presidency was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty. \"In all the years I sat in the House, I never knew Mr. Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false. He never attempted to shade a statement, and I never heard him utter an unkind word,\" said Martha Griffiths.The trust the American public had in him was rapidly and severely tarnished by his pardon of Nixon. Nonetheless, many grant in hindsight that he had respectably discharged with considerable dignity a great responsibility that he had not sought.In spite of his athletic record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired a reputation as a clumsy, likable, and simple-minded everyman. An incident in 1975, when he tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by Chevy Chase on Saturday Night Live, cementing Ford's image as a klutz. Other pieces of the everyman image were attributed to his inevitable comparison with Nixon, his Midwestern stodginess and his self-deprecation.Ford has notably been portrayed in two television productions which included a central focus on his wife: the Emmy-winning 1987 ABC biographical television movie The Betty Ford Story and the 2022 Showtime television series The First Lady. Honors Foreign honors Estonia: First Class of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana (7 January 1997) Ford received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in May 1970, as well as the Silver Buffalo Award, from the Boy Scouts of America. In 1974, he also received the highest distinction of the Scout Association of Japan, the Golden Pheasant Award. In 1985, he received the 1985 Old Tom Morris Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, GCSAA's highest honor. In 1992, the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation awarded Ford its Lone Sailor Award for his naval service and his subsequent government service. In 1999, Ford was honored with a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars. Also in 1999, Ford was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bill Clinton. In 2001, he was presented with the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award for his decision to pardon Richard Nixon to stop the agony America was experiencing over Watergate.The following were named after Ford: The Ford House Office Building in the U.S. Capitol Complex, formerly House Annex 2.

Biography He was born to Demetrio Yglesias Llorente and Eudoxia Castro Fernandez, whose father was also president, the \"Founder of the Republic\" Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Castro who served two terms, 1847\u20131849 and 1866\u20131868. Yglesias traveled to the United States and to Europe to further his education. He also studied law at the University of Santo Tomas, but was unable to complete his studies due to his parents' economic difficulties at the time. He went into business, but did not meet with much success in that arena. He got married in a civil ceremony to Rosa Banuet Ross in Cartago. They had two girls, Berta and Rosa (*official records of this marriage were destroyed in the earthquake of Cartago in 1910). He served as Minister of War from 1890-4. Yglesias and Rosa were divorced due to family pressure, and he married Manuela Petronila de la Trinidad Rodr\u00edguez Alvarado, daughter of President Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Zeled\u00f3n (1890-1894). She was a private woman, and did not share his enthusiasm for the political arena. They had a happy domestic partnership, and produced eleven children; Miguel, Eduardo, Luisa, Eudoxia, Bernardo Rafael, Margarita, Maria de los Angeles, Manuel, Jose Maria and Rafael. Presidency In 1894, at the age of 33, Yglesias was elected president by a majority of 23,000, and his election was marked with by largest voter turnout to date. Upon his election, he made official visits to Paris and London. He had an audience with Queen Victoria, for whom he had great respect. Duly impressed by the technological advancements he saw in Europe, he decided to return to Costa Rica and modernize it. He completed the construction of a national theater (Teatro Nacional), and was present at its inaugural performance of Faust presented by a French company under the auspices of Frederic Aubrey. He established the colon as the unit of currency, and put Costa Rica on the gold standard. He completed the Atlantic to Pacific railway, and built up the coastal town of Puerto Limon. In addition, he set up a department of sanitation in the city. He oversaw the building of an electric tram, and brought municipal electricity to the city of Heredia. He established a house of correction for minors. He also instituted educational reforms, establishing a precedent for text books to be authored by Costa Rican citizens. A firm believer in public education, he founded a school for the arts (Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes) in 1897. Yglesias was the first president to send a scientific expedition to Isla del Coco. Hearing of its rich natural resources, Yglesias closed the penal colony that was there, and decreed the island a nature preserve. Yglesias established a system of emergency health care in the provinces. In 1895, Congress approved a measure to create a board of medicine, surgery and pharmacy, composed of all the doctors, surgeons and pharmacists that had been nationally certified. In 1902, he established the pharmaceutical college (Instituto de Farmacia). He tried to amend the constitution to allow for a third term, but was defeated. He ran for president again in 1909 and 1913, but was never re-elected. Later life and death Yglesias still kept his hand in politics, and served, in 1919, as Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Guatemala. Yglesias died in San Jose in 1924, and was buried in the Cementerio General de San Jose. In 1981 he was awarded \"Benemerito de la Patria\" for his years of service.

He was the bench coach for the Cincinnati Reds, and was the bench coach for the New Zealand national baseball team that competed in the 2013 World Baseball Classic.  Career Bell played his high school baseball at J.M. Tate High School, located in Cantonment, Florida. A first-round pick of the Minnesota Twins in 1984, Bell made 129 errors over his first three minor-league seasons. The following year he was traded to the Cleveland Indians in a deal that brought starter Bert Blyleven to the Twins. When he finally reached the majors in 1986, he faced Blyleven in his first major-league at-bat. During this moment, Bell ripped the first pitch he saw from Blyleven for a home run.Bell maintained his reputation as one of the best shortstops in the 1990s. His range was only average but he had a great knowledge of the hitters and positioned himself well. He won a Gold Glove Award in 1993, breaking a string of thirteen straight National League Gold Gloves at shortstop by Ozzie Smith. It was also the first Gold Glove by a Pirate shortstop since Gene Alley's back-to-back honors in 1966 and 1967. Though mostly a singles and doubles hitter at first, Bell was also an expert at bunting. Bell did show early signs of his power potential hitting 21 home runs in 1997 and 20 in 1998. A trial switch to second base at end of the '98 season became a permanent move the next spring. Bell belted 36 of his 38 homers from his new position, a total exceeded only by Rogers Hornsby, Davey Johnson and Ryne Sandberg among second basemen. One of those round-trippers was a sixth-inning grand slam off the Oakland Athletics pitcher Jimmy Haynes on the final game before the All-Star break, which won $1 million for an Arizona fan, Gylene Hoyle, who had correctly predicted the batter and the inning for a bases-loaded blast. In his career, Bell batted .265, with 195 home runs, 868 runs batted in, 1,123 runs scored, 1,964 hits, 394 doubles, 67 triples and 91 stolen bases. As a player, Bell was well known for wearing eyeglasses on the field. Coaching career After the 2006 season, Bell retired as bench coach of the Arizona Diamondbacks in order to spend more time with his family, who are located in Phoenix, Arizona and Tampa, Florida. He currently has a ballfield named after him in Phoenix, called Jay Bell Field. He became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. 75% of the vote was necessary for induction, and 5% was necessary to stay on the ballot. He received 0.4% of the vote and dropped off the ballot.Currently, Bell serves as a member of the advisory board of the Baseball Assistance Team, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro league players through financial and medical difficulties. In 2012, he served as the hitting coach for the Mobile BayBears, the Double-A affiliate of the Diamondbacks. Bell was hired as the hitting coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates on October 31, 2012. On November 11, 2013, Bell was named bench coach of the Cincinnati Reds. On October 22, 2015, it was announced that the Reds would not renew Bell's contract. On January 13, 2017, Bell became the manager for the Class A (Advanced) Tampa Yankees.On August 29, 2017, Bell became the manager of the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League.

She competed in the women's individual foil event at the 1956 Summer Olympics.  Early life Lois Duncan Steinmetz was born on April 28, 1934, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the first child of Lois Duncan (n\u00e9e Foley) and Joseph Janney Steinmetz. Duncan had one younger brother, William Janney \"Billy\" Steinmetz. Both of Duncan's parents were professional magazine photographers, who took photos for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.She spent her early life in Pennsylvania, relocating in her late childhood to Sarasota, Florida, where her parents resumed their employment as circus photographers. In Florida, she spent her youth among circus performers, including The Doll Family. Her experience growing up in this environment eventually served as the basis of her picture books The Circus Comes Home (1993) and Song of the Circus (2002).Duncan described herself as a \"shy, fat little girl,\" a \"bookworm and dreamer\", who spent her childhood playing in the woods. Duncan cited The Princess and the Goblin and The Wizard of Oz and Mary Poppins series among her favorite novels as a child. She started writing and submitting manuscripts to magazines at age 10, and sold her first story at the age of 13. At age 15, Duncan was photographed by her father posed at Siesta Key, and the photo appeared on the cover of the July 9, 1949, issue of Collier's magazine.She graduated from Sarasota High School in 1952. The following autumn, she enrolled at Duke University, but dropped out in 1953 to start a family with Joseph Cardozo, a fellow student she had met at the university. Career Early publications After dropping out of college, Duncan continued to write and publish magazine articles; she wrote over 300 articles published in magazines such as Ladies' Home Journal, Redbook, McCall's, Good Housekeeping, and Reader's Digest. She published her first novel, Love Song for Joyce, in 1958 under the pen name Lois Kerry, followed by Debutante Hill in 1959; the latter was initially rejected for a literary prize because it featured an adolescent character drinking a beer.In 1962, Duncan moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, with her children after divorcing her first husband, Joseph Cardozo, and supported herself writing greeting cards and fictional confessionals for pulp magazines. In 1966, she published the novel Ransom, detailing a group of students held captive on a school bus, which earned her an Edgar Allan Poe Award nomination, as well as marking her shift from romance to more suspense-oriented works.In the early 1970s, Duncan was hired to teach journalism at the University of New Mexico. \"I was hired on a fluke,\" Duncan recalled in a 2011 interview: Her friend, who was the chair of the journalism department, hired her as a replacement based on her experience writing for magazines, despite the fact that she did not have a degree. While teaching, Duncan enrolled in classes at the university, earning her Bachelor of Arts in English in 1977.In 1970, she published the historical novel Peggy, chronicling the life of Peggy Shippen, followed by the 1971 children's book Hotel for Dogs, which was later adapted as a 2009 film of the same name starring Emma Roberts. Suspense and horror novels Influenced by her own interest in the supernatural and speculative fiction, Duncan wrote various suspense and horror novels aimed for teenagers. Some of her works have been adapted for the screen, the most infamous example being the 1997 film I Know What You Did Last Summer, adapted from her 1973 novel of the same title, an adaptation she was not fond of due to her daughter's murder the prior decade. After the publication of I Know What You Did Last Summer, Duncan wrote Down a Dark Hall (1974), a Gothic novel following four students at an isolated and mysterious boarding school. In 1976, she published the supernatural horror novel Summer of Fear, which was also adapted into a 1978 film by director Wes Craven.In 1978, Duncan published the controversial Killing Mr. Griffin, a novel that details three high-school students' murder of their English teacher. Critic Margery Fisher noted Duncan's \"unreserved\" approach to writing the novel, in language she described as both \"harsh and literal.\" Richard Peck of The New York Times also praised the novel, writing: \"Duncan breaks some new ground in a novel without sex, drugs, or black leather jackets, but the taboo she tampers with is far more potent and pervasive: the unleashed fury of the permissively reared against any assault on their egos and authority ... The value of the book lies in the twisted logic of the teenagers and how easily they can justify anything.\" Killing Mr. Griffin was one of Duncan's major critical successes, and was selected as an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults that year.In the 1980s, Duncan would publish several more horror novels with supernatural themes, including Stranger with My Face (1981), about a teenage girl's experiences with astral projection, and The Third Eye (1984), also with psychic themes. In 1985, she wrote another suspense novel, Locked in Time. Later works In 1988 and 1989, Duncan published the thriller novels The Twisted Window and Don't Look Behind You, respectively. From 1987 to 1989, Duncan wrote several picture books for young children, some paired with audio CDs of songs for children, including Songs from Dreamland, Dream Songs from Yesterday, Our Beautiful Day, and The Story of Christmas.After the murder of her youngest daughter, Kaitlyn, in 1989, she only wrote one more horror novel, a supernatural thriller titled Gallows Hill (1997). The murder of Duncan's daughter marked a shift in her writing, and she spent the remainder of her career writing thematically lighter material, mainly children's chapter and picture books. In 1992, she published Who Killed My Daughter?, a nonfiction account of her daughter's unsolved murder.In the 2000s, Duncan wrote two sequels to Hotel for Dogs: News for Dogs (2009) and Movie for Dogs (2010), both children's novels. She also published her second collection of poetry in 2007, titled Seasons of the Heart. Her final book, a nonfiction sequel to Who Killed My Daughter? titled One to the Wolves, was published in 2013 with a foreword by Ann Rule.Beginning in 2010, 10 of Duncan's most successful teen novels were updated for a new generation and re-released in paperback with modern cover designs. For the new editions, Duncan gave characters updated wardrobes, more contemporary dialogue, and access to technologies such as cell phones. Personal life Duncan had three children with her first husband, Joseph Cardozo: daughters Robin and Kerry, and son Brett. Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1962. In 1965, she married Donald Arquette, an electrical engineer; they had two children: son Donald, Jr., and daughter Kaitlyn. Her three oldest children all took her second husband's name.In 1989, the youngest of Duncan's children, Kaitlyn Arquette, was murdered in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Who Killed My Daughter? relates fact and conjecture about the case, which appeared to be a random act of violence. Duncan had said that her \"dream is to write a sequel to Who Killed My Daughter? to give our family's true-life horror story a closure. Of course, for that to be possible, Kait's case must be solved.\" Duncan also founded a research center to help investigate cold cases, which later became the nonprofit Resource Center for Victims of Violent Deaths. After her daughter's death, Duncan began writing children's picture books, saying that she could no longer write about young women in life-threatening situations.On August 23, 2021, Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina announced that a suspect was picked up in July on unrelated charges. Paul Apodaca had confessed to Arquette's murder, as well as two other murders around the same time, one of which was the murder by stabbing of Althea Oakley, a University of New Mexico student. On February 21, 2022, Apodaca was indicted in the murder of Arquette. Death On June 15, 2016, at the age of 82, Duncan died at her home in Bradenton, Florida, of undisclosed causes. Her husband, Donald Arquette Sr., noted that Duncan had suffered a series of strokes in the years prior. Honors and legacy Duncan is credited by many critics and journalists as a pioneering figure of young-adult fiction, particularly the teen suspense and horror genres, and has been dubbed the \"queen of teen thrillers.\" As noted by Emily Langer of The Washington Post, Duncan often \"plucked her characters from normalcy and placed them in extraordinary, often dark circumstances,\" in contrast to her contemporaries such as Beverly Cleary, Judy Blume, and Robert Cormier.The ALA Margaret A. Edwards Award recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for \"significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature\". Duncan won the annual award in 1992 and the Young Adult Librarians now name six books published from 1966 to 1987, the autobiographical Chapters and five novels: Ransom, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Summer of Fear, Killing Mr. Griffin, and The Twisted Window. The citation observes, \"Whether accepting responsibility for the death of an English teacher or admitting to their responsibility for a hit-and-run accident, Duncan's characters face a universal truth\u2014your actions are important and you are responsible for them.\"In 2014, Duncan was awarded the Grand Master award from the Mystery Writers of America alongside James Ellroy in New York City.

He was a member of parliament from 2007 to 2012, where he was Leader of the Opposition of Bermuda from 21 January 2008 until 16 May 2011. He also served as a UBP Senator from 1998 to 2007.  Early life Swan is the eldest son of working-class parents, Hubert E. E. Swan (a career police officer) and Barbara Swan of Southampton. He spent many of his formative years with his maternal grandparents, John and Ivy Anderson. Through his paternal grandfather, Swan is a 6th-generation descendant of Charles Roach Ratteray (1799\u20131872), a renowned ship builder, entrepreneur and pioneer of the AME Church in Bermuda.. Swan attended Southampton Glebe, Berkeley Institute and Warwick Secondary Schools in Bermuda before receiving his tertiary education at Palm Beach Junior College (now Palm Beach State College) in Lake Worth, Florida. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Troy State University in Troy, Alabama in 1980. Golf career Swan learned the game of golf from his uncle, Herman Santucci Bascome, a former golf pro at Ocean View Golf Course in Bermuda, while growing up at the newly developed government-owned Port Royal Golf Course in the early 1970s. He was a member of the then Palm Beach Junior College golf team led by Ken Green, which finished 4th in the State Junior College Championship in 1978, before joining Troy State University golf team. Individually, he won medalist honours at the Northeast Louisiana University Invitational at Chenault Park Municipal Golf Course in Monroe, Louisiana. He played under legendary golf coach Mike Griffin at Troy. He led the Troy team that placed 4th in the 1979 NCAA Division II Golf Championship at El Macero Country Club in Davis, California, and was named Troy's MVP in 1979. As an amateur golfer, Swan also participated in major amateur events including the 1974 Orange Bowl Junior Championship in Miami, Florida, and two World Amateur Team Championships (for the Eisenhower Trophy) in 1978 in Fiji and 1980 in the United States. Swan turned professional in 1980, qualified for the European Tour in 1980, and competed for two years. He partnered with fellow Bermudian Keith Smith to qualify for the 1984, and for three Bermuda Open Golf Championships. He also partnered with Dwayne Pearman in the 1993 World Cup of Golf. Since 2012, Swan has been the teaching golf pro at Port Royal Golf Course. As an independent contractor, he created the Port Royal Golf Developmental Program for new golfers. Political career Initially, Swan contested four general elections over 25 years before winning a seat in the House of Assembly of Bermuda in December 2007. He served in the Senate of Bermuda as a UBP nominee for 9 years (1998\u20132007), became Opposition Senate Leader in 2001, and served as Senate Leader under four Opposition Leaders, until his election to the Bermuda House of Assembly at the 2007 election. He became party leader, and on 21 January 2008 became Leader of the Opposition, a position he held until 16 May 2011. UBP was in merger negotiations with the Bermuda Democratic Alliance; and, following the Central Council's 3 May 2011 vote to disband the UBP, several general members of UBP expressed concern that there was no special general meeting on the issue in any of the party's 36 branches. Swan and others petitioned the party executive to hold a public meeting, but their pleas were ignored. When he and the others attempted to convene a dispute tribunal under Section 13 of the UBP constitution, they were also ignored. On 10 May 2011, Swan, three other former party chairmen and others successfully filed a court injunction preventing UBP from disbanding. On 15 May 2011, seven of the nine UBP members resigned and joined the Bermuda Democratic Alliance; and on 16 May, Swan notified the governor of his resignation as Leader of the Opposition. Swan and the others dropped their injunction, permitting the UBP executive to settle its affairs. However, Swan continued to sit in the House of Assembly and said he planned to rebuild the party. When the House of Assembly was dissolved for the 17 December 2012 election, he ran as an independent. He finished third, receiving 23% of the vote behind 39% for the new One Bermuda Alliance, only narrowly besting 38% for the Progressive Labour Party candidate. It was the only constituency where the winner received less than 40% of the vote. In 2014, Swan accepted an invitation from Leader of the Opposition Marc Bean to join the Progressive Labour Party.

Background She was born in L\u00e9og\u00e2ne to a poor but free family as the daughter of Guillaume Bonheur and Marie-Sainte Lobelot. She was educated by her aunt \u00c9lise Lobelot, who was the governess of a religious order. She married Pierre Lunic, master-cartwright to the Brothers of Saint-Jean de Dieu. She became a widow in 1795. The siege of Jacmel During the siege of Jacmel in 1800, she made herself a name for her work for the wounded and starving. She managed to convince Dessalines, who was one of the parties besieging the city, to allow some roads to the city to be opened, so that the wounded in the city could receive help. She led a procession of women and children with food, clothes and medicine back to the city, and then arranged for the food to be cooked on the streets. Life with Dessalines On 2 April 1800, she married Jean-Jacques Dessalines, with whom she had a long-time relationship. They had seven children: Princess Marie Fran\u00e7oise C\u00e9lim\u00e8ne Dessalines (Saint-Marc, 2 October 1789 \u2013 1859). Legitimated by the subsequent marriage of her parents.

Princess Serine Dessalines.Marie-Claire was described as kind, merciful and natural, with an elegant and cordial manner. She adopted the numerous children produced by Dessalines' adulterous affairs. She was a contrast to her husband in her tolerance and support and by showing indiscriminate kindness to people of all colors. She was a great opponent of Dessalines' policy toward the white French people of Haiti; she saw to the needs of the prisoners, and she did not hesitate, despite her husband's anger, to save many of them from battle wounds suffered during the revolution war. She is reported to have fallen to her knees before him to beg him to spare their lives and is said to have hidden one of them, Descourtilz, under her own bed to save him. She was made Empress of Haiti in 1804 upon the creation of the monarchy of Haiti, and crowned with her husband at the Church of Champ de Mars on 8 October 1804. She kept the status for two years. Later life After the deposition and death of her Dessalines in 1806, she denied the offer from Henry Christophe to move in with his family. As a widow, she was styled Princess Dowager on 17 October 1806. As the property of her late husband was confiscated, she lived in poverty in Saint-Marc until August 1843, when she was granted a pension 1,200 gourdes. In 1849, when Faustin I of Haiti became Emperor, he idealized the late Dessalines and enlarged Marie-Claire's pension as a sign of his admiration. Marie-Claire, who felt no sympathy for this attitude, refused the money. She moved in with her granddaughter, and lived in poverty until her death in 1858 in Gona\u00efves. Legacy In her honour, the Fondation Marie-Claire Heureuse F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Bonheur Dessalines, also known as the Fondasyon F\u00e9licit\u00e9 (FF), was established by Dr Bayyinah Bello in 1999 to undertake humanitarian, social and educational work in Haiti. Soon after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the non-profit organization Friends of Fondation F\u00e9licit\u00e9 was set up to support FF in helping the Haitian people to rebuild their country.

He is most notable for commanding the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division throughout the campaign in Western Europe from June 1944 until Victory in Europe Day in May 1945, and later rose to become Quartermaster-General to the Forces.  Early life and military career Born in Marylebone, London, on 23 July 1893, Ivor Thomas was the son of John Thomas, the harpist to Queen Victoria and King Edward VII and Joan Francis, the youngest daughter of William Denny. He attended Cheltenham College in Gloucestershire and later the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from where he was commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery on 20 December 1912.Thomas fought in the First World War, arriving on the Western Front from India with II Battery, XIII Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, part of the 7th (Meerut) Division, in October 1914. Still a second lieutenant when war began, Thomas rose rapidly in rank, being made a lieutenant on 9 June 1915, a temporary captain on 12 January 1916 (made permanent on 20 December 1916, four years since he was commissioned), and an acting major on 10 April 1917, which he held for only five days, but he regained the rank on 15 June, which he held until 2 October, when he again reverted to his permanent rank of captain. He remained on the Western Front throughout the conflict, was wounded twice, awarded the Military Cross and Bar and Mentioned in Despatches in 1917, and, in January 1918, received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). The citation for the medal reads: For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. When his battery was being relieved the position was shelled by an intense bombardment, which lasted for over two hours and caused many casualties in Loth batteries. The pits and ammunition of one section caught fire, and he succeeded in extinguishing this. Later, the telephone pit and mess shelter were wrecked, and he immediately led the way to the rescue of wounded men inside. The camouflage nets of three more guns were then set alight, and the ammunition began to catch fire. This he also saved by tearing down the burning camouflage and smothering the smouldering ammunition, some of which had already begun to explode. Not until all the fires had been extinguished, and he had seen every man, both wounded and unwounded, clear of the position, did he seek cover for himself. His great gallantry and exceptional coolness throughout the whole of this time were worthy of the highest praise. From 22 September he served as a staff captain at the War Office. Between the wars Relinquishing this appointment on 19 November 1919, over a year after the war ended, the first few years of the interwar period for Thomas were spent as an adjutant to various Territorial Army (TA) units, including the 68th (South Midland) Field Brigade, Royal Artillery, part of the 48th (South Midland) Division, until attending the Staff College, Camberley from 1924 to 1925. After this he became a brigade major with the artillery of the 1st Infantry Division in Aldershot Command from 1926 to 1930, during which time he was made a brevet major on 1 July 1929.In 1931 Thomas served at the Royal Artillery depot at Woolwich, Kent, before in January 1932 becoming a General staff Officer Grade 2 (GSO2) to General Sir David Campbell, the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Malta. After being promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1933, he returned to England and attended the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in 1934. This was followed by serving as a GSO2 at the War Office and later GSO1, being promoted to colonel on 12 May 1938 (with seniority dating back to 1 July 1937). Promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier on 14 July 1939, he was appointed Deputy Director for Recruiting and Organisation at the War Office, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, and then he was Director of Organisation at the War Office in 1940, by which time the war had begun. Second World War In September 1940 Thomas, by now a temporary brigadier, became Commander Royal Artillery (CRA) of the 2nd Infantry Division, which had recently fought in France with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and was then commanded by Major General Noel Irwin before being succeeded by Major General Daril Watson, both of whom had been fellow students at the Staff College in the mid-1920s.Thomas remained in this post until March 1942, when he was promoted to the acting rank of major general and became General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, his first time in charge of a large formation of infantry, succeeding Major General Charles Allfrey, another artilleryman. The 43rd Division \u2013 composed of the 128th, 129th and 130th Infantry Brigades, along with supporting divisional troops \u2013 was a first line TA formation recruiting from the West Country, serving in Kent on anti-invasion duties as part of XII Corps, under Lieutenant General James Gammell, who was replaced in November by Lieutenant General Montagu Stopford who, the following November, was himself replaced by Lieutenant General Neil Ritchie.In June 1942, three months after Thomas became GOC, the 43rd Division was one of many selected to be converted into a \"mixed\" division, of one tank brigade and two infantry brigades. As a result, Brigadier Manley James's 128th Brigade left the division and was replaced by the 25th Tank Brigade which, in September, was replaced by the 34th Tank Brigade. Two months later, on 11 November, Thomas was promoted to the permanent rank of major general. In September 1943, however, the experiment with \"mixed\" divisions was abandoned and, with the arrival of Brigadier Hubert Essame's 214th Infantry Brigade, formerly an independent unit, the division reverted to being a standard infantry division. By this time Thomas's division had been selected to participate in the Allied invasion of Normandy, then scheduled to take place in May 1944, as part of the newly formed British Second Army (initially under Lieutenant General Sir Kenneth Anderson but later replaced in January 1944 by Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey), and training in all-arms co-operation, already at a very high standard due to Thomas's energetic and ruthless methods, intensified, and he demanded only the very highest standards. After years of training under Thomas's command, the 43rd Division landed in Normandy in mid-June 1944, but was not immediately involved in any major engagements. However, casualties had already been sustained, by the 43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Francis Lane Fox\u2212who \"Von Thoma\" later sacked\u2212which suffered severe losses before it even landed in Normandy. On 24 June, the 43rd Division was reassigned from Ritchie's XII Corps to Lieutenant General Sir Richard O'Connor's VIII Corps and, days later, took part in Operation Epsom, in an attempt to capture Caen, which, although a D-Day objective for the 3rd Division, still remained in enemy hands. The division only played a relatively minor role in the operation but played a major role in Operation Jupiter, the British attempt to capture Hill 112. The operation, which commenced on 10 July and ended the following day, was ultimately a British victory, but cost Thomas's division, along with the armoured support in the shape of Brigadier Michael Carver's 4th Armoured Brigade, almost 2,000 casualties. Carver later described Thomas as, \"a small, fiery, very determined and grim gunner, without a spark of humour, he would bite the head off anyone who attempted to disagree with him or question his orders.\"Transferring back to Ritchie's XII Corps, the division had little time for rest for its next battle, the Second Battle of the Odon. The operation was unable to fully achieve its objectives, costing the division further casualties it could ill-afford. It had, however, drawn the attention of the German panzer divisions away from the American front and onto the British front.Still part of Horrocks's XXX Corps, Thomas's division's next role was Operation Market Garden, the Allies' attempt to end the war before Christmas 1944. Thomas was closely involved in Operation Berlin to rescue the British 1st Airborne Division, and lead the ad hoc force in the defence of the Nijmegen salient early in October.From 27 December 1944 until 28 January 1945, during the Battle of the Bulge in which the 43rd Division played no part, Thomas was temporarily given command of XXX Corps by Montgomery, while Horrocks, the GOC, was away in England to rest.The division's next role was in Operation Blackcock. Again part of XXX Corps, which was now transferred from Dempsey's British Second Army to General Harry Crerar's First Canadian Army, the 43rd Division's next role was a major one in Operation Veritable. Postwar After the war he was appointed GOC I Corps District within the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) in 1945 and then Administrator for the Polish Armed Forces in the West under British Command in 1947. He became General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) Anti-Aircraft Command in 1948 and Quartermaster-General to the Forces in 1950; he retired in 1952.

He died on his estate on Waccamaw River, near Georgetown, South Carolina; interment was in All Saints' Churchyard.  Early life and U.S. Army career Huger was born in 1805 in Charleston, South Carolina. (He pronounced his name , although today many Charlestonians say .) He was a son of Francis Kinloch Huger and his wife Harriet Lucas Pinckney, making him a grandson of Maj. Gen. Thomas Pinckney. His paternal grandfather, also named Benjamin Huger, was a patriot in the American Revolution, killed at Charleston during the British occupation.In 1821 Huger entered the United States Military Academy at West Point and graduated four years later, standing eighth out of 37 cadets. On July 1, 1825, he was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant, then promoted to second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery on that same date. He served as a topographical engineer until 1828, when he took a leave of absence from the Army to visit Europe from 1828 to 1830. He then was on recruiting duty, after which he served as part of Fort Trumbull's garrison in New London, Connecticut. From 1832 to 1839 Huger commanded the Fortress Monroe arsenal located in Hampton, Virginia.On February 7, 1831, Huger married his first cousin, Elizabeth Celestine Pinckney. They would have five children together; Benjamin, Eustis, Francis, Thomas Pinckney and Celestine Pinckney. One of his sons, Francis (Frank) Kinloch Huger, also attended West Point and graduated in 1860. Frank Huger would enter the Confederate forces during the American Civil War as well, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel and leading a battalion of field artillery by the end of the conflict. On May 30, 1832, Huger was transferred to the Army's ordnance department with the rank of captain; he would spend the rest of his U.S. Army career with this branch. From 1839 to 1846 he served as a member of the U.S. Army Ordnance Board, and from 1840 into 1841 he was on official duty in Europe. Huger again commanded the Fort Monroe Arsenal from 1841 to 1846, until hostilities began with Mexico. War with Mexico Huger fought notably in 1846\u201348 during the Mexican\u2013American War, serving as chief of ordnance on the staff of Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott throughout the conflict. Huger had command of the siege train during the Siege of Veracruz, March 9\u201329, 1847. He was appointed to the rank of brevet major for his performance at the Veracruz on March 29, and to lieutenant colonel for the Battle of Molino del Rey on September 8. Huger was brevetted a colonel five days later for \"gallant and meritorious conduct\" during the storming of Chapultepec.Returning from Mexico, Huger was appointed to a board which created an instructional system for teaching artillery principles in the US Army. From 1848 to 1851 he once more commanded the arsenal at Fort Monroe, and then led the arsenal at Harpers Ferry until 1854. During 1852 his home state presented him with a sword, commemorating Huger's long and distinguished service to South Carolina. From 1854 to 1860, he commanded the arsenal located at Pikesville in Baltimore County, Maryland, during which he was promoted to major as of February 15, 1855. Huger was then sent to the Crimean War as an official foreign observer in 1856. Beginning in 1860, Huger commanded the Charleston Arsenal, holding the post until resigning in the spring of 1861. American Civil War service Despite the secession of his home state in December 1860, Huger remained in the U.S. Army until after the Battle of Fort Sumter, resigning effective April 22, 1861. Just prior to the battle, Huger traveled to the fort and conferred with its commander, Maj. Robert Anderson, to determine where he stood. Although Anderson was also Southern-born, he had already chosen to follow the Union cause, and Huger left when \"their discussions came to naught.\"Huger was commissioned an infantry lieutenant colonel in the regular Confederate Army on March 16, and then briefly commanded the forces in and around Norfolk, Virginia. On May 22 he was appointed a brigadier general in the state's militia, and the next day took command of the Department of Norfolk, with defensive responsibilities for North Carolina and southern Virginia, with his headquarters located at Norfolk. Sometime that June he was also commissioned a brigadier in the Virginia Provisional Army, however Huger entered the Confederate volunteer forces on June 17 as a brigadier general. Later on October 7 he was promoted to the rank of major general. Roanoke Island and the loss of Norfolk In early 1862 Union Army and Navy forces approached the North Carolina-Virginia coastline and Huger's area of responsibility. At Roanoke Island his subordinate, Brig. Gen. Henry A. Wise, asked Huger for a variety of supplies, ammunition, field artillery, and most importantly additional men, greatly fearing an attack on his quite unfinished defenses. Huger's response to Wise asked him to rely on \"hard work and coolness among the troops you have, instead of more men.\" Eventually Confederate President Jefferson Davis did order Huger to send help to the Roanoke Island area, but it proved too late. On February 7\u20138 Flag Officer Louis M. Goldsborough and his gunboats landed Brig. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside's infantry, initiating the Battle of Roanoke Island. Huger, having about 13,000 soldiers, failed to reinforce the immediate commanders there, an ailing Wise and Col. H. M. Shaw, and Burnside quickly eliminated the Confederate resistance and forced a surrender.When news of the fall of Roanoke Island reached the population of Norfolk they quickly panicked, spreading the alarm to Richmond. Military historian Shelby Foote believed this loss \"...shook whatever confidence the citizens had managed to retain in Huger, who was charged with their defense.\" On February 27, President Davis declared martial law in Norfolk and suspended the right of habeas corpus, attempting to regain control, and two days later he did the same in Richmond. Due to the combination of the naval action at Elizabeth City on February 10, the Battle of New Bern on March 14, the Battle of South Mills on April 19, and other Union landings during the Peninsula Campaign, Confederate authorities determined Huger could not hold Norfolk. On April 27 he was ordered by Gen. Joseph E. Johnston to abandon the area, salvaging from Gosport Navy Yard as much usable equipment as he could, and join the main army. On May 1 Huger began to evacuate his men and ordered the destruction by fire of the naval yards at both Norfolk as well as nearby Portsmouth. Ten days later Union forces occupied the Gosport Yards. Military historian Webb Garrison, Jr. believed Huger did not leave the area properly, stating: \"...the evacuation of Norfolk was handled poorly by Confederate Gen. Benjamin Huger\u2014too much property was left intact.\" Also lost as a result was the famous Ironclad warship CSS Virginia, scuttled by her own crew when she could not stay in the James River, get past Union Naval forces at its mouth, nor survive at sea even if it did. The Union would control the facilities at Norfolk for the rest of the war, and the Confederate Congress soon began to investigate Huger's part in the defeat at Roanoke Island. He led his soldiers to Petersburg, where he remained until summoned by Johnston at the end of May. Peninsula Campaign Confederate President Jefferson Davis assigned Huger to divisional command under Gen. Johnston within the Army of Northern Virginia. His command fell back with the main body as Johnston retired towards Richmond, and then participated in the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31 and June 1, 1862. According to Johnston's battle plan, Huger's three brigades were placed under the command of Maj. Gen. James Longstreet as a support, but Huger was never notified of this. On June 1 as he moved his men toward the fight, their march was blocked by Longstreet's columns\u2014who had taken an incorrect road\u2014and halted. Huger found Longstreet, asked about the delay, and for the first time learned his role and the command relationship. Huger then asked whether he or Longstreet was the senior officer and was told that Longstreet was, which he accepted as true although it was not. This delay and Longstreet's instructions to stand by and wait for orders prevented Huger's division from supporting the advance on time and hampered the overall Confederate attack. In his official report of the Battle of Seven Pines, Longstreet unjustly blamed Huger for the less than completely successful action, complaining of his tardiness on May 31 but not relating the reason for the delay. In a private letter to an injured Johnston written on June 7, Longstreet stated: The failure of complete success on Saturday [May 31] I attribute to the slow movements of Gen. Huger's command... I can't help but think that a display of his forces on the left flank of the enemy, by Gen. Huger, would have completed the affair... Slow men are a little out of place upon the field. Once he learned he had been criticized and blamed, Huger asked Johnston to investigate; however this was refused. He then asked President Davis to order a court-martial, but, although approved, it never took place. Writing after the war, Edward Porter Alexander stated, referring to Huger, \"Indeed, it is almost tragic the way in which he became the scapegoat of this occasion.\" The Seven Days Huger then participated in several of the Seven Days Battles with the Army of Northern Virginia, now under the command of Gen. Robert E. Lee, who replaced the wounded Johnston on June 1. Lee planned an offensive in late June against an isolated Union Army corps with the bulk of his army, leaving less than 30,000 men in the Richmond trenches to defend the Confederate capital. This force consisted of the divisions of Maj. Gens. John B. Magruder, Theophilus H. Holmes, and Huger. During the Battle of Oak Grove on June 25, his portion of the line was attacked by two divisions of the Union III Corps led by Brig. Gens. Joseph Hooker and Philip Kearny. When part of the assault faltered in rough terrain, Huger took advantage of the confused, uneven Union line and counterattacked with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright. After repulsing the charge, another Union force attacked Huger but was also stopped short of the line. The Battle of Oak Grove cost Huger 541 men killed and wounded, while inflicting 626 total casualties on the Union Army. Lee continued to order his army to pursue and destroy the Union forces. Following the action at Oak Grove, he pulled much of the defense around Richmond and added them to the chase, Huger's division included. On June 29, Magruder thought his position was to be attacked by overwhelming numbers and asked for reinforcements. Lee sent two brigades from Huger's division in response with instructions they were to be returned at 2 p.m. if Magruder was not hit by then. The appointed hour came and passed, Huger's men were sent back, and later that day Magruder \"halfheartedly\" fought the Battle of Savage's Station alone. Even without those two brigades, Huger was late in reaching his assigned position on June 29, countermarching needlessly and encamping his command without engaging with the enemy. The next day Huger was ordered toward Glendale but was delayed by the retreating Union forces, who had cut trees to slow pursuit, and also by the terrain which easily allowed for ambush. Attempting to follow along the Charles City Road to his assignment, Huger had his men cut a new path through the woods with axes. This further slowed their advance, while the other Confederate commands waited for his guns to fire, which was their signal to attack. Huger informed Lee of the delay by simply stating his march was \"obstructed\" without further description.Around 2 p.m. Huger's lead brigade under Brig. Gen. William Mahone cut a mile-long path around the Union obstacles, winning the so-called \"battle of the axes\" and continued to approach Glendale. There he saw the 6,000-man division of Brig. Gen. Henry W. Slocum arrayed to block his way. Huger ordered one of his artillery batteries to fire on this Union position at 2:30 p.m. but Slocum's guns answered quickly, and Huger led his 9,000 men off the road and into the woods after taking some casualties. Despite outnumbering the Union division Huger made no further attempts to reach Glendale. However his few artillery shots were interpreted by the other Confederates as the signal to attack, igniting the Battle of Glendale, although Huger and his command would not take part in the fight and camped. The following day, July 1, turned out to be Huger's last fight with the Army of Northern Virginia as well as his final field command in the American Civil War. His division was directed toward the Union forces on Malvern Hill without a definite target, as he was told that Lee would \"place him where most needed\" against the position. Because Magruder had mistakenly led his command away from the battle, Huger took up his place on the Confederate right, just north of the \"Crew House\", with the division of Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill on his left. To give his infantry a chance to charge and break the Union line, Lee ordered a concentrated artillery barrage at Malvern Hill. One of Huger's brigades, led by Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead, was to determine when this barrage had the desired effect and begin the assault. Before the cannonade could begin however, the Union artillery fired first and took out most of the Confederate guns. Shortly after 2:30 p.m. Armistead went in anyway, and though his men made some progress he failed to penetrate the strong defensive position. Other Confederate units made less progress and took heavy casualties, and around 4 p.m. Magruder arrived and put in two brigades\u2014about a third of his command\u2014behind Armistead, but he too retired with high loss. Two more of Huger's brigades\u2014led by Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright and Mahone, about 2,500 men\u2014followed Armistead and toward Malvern Hill. Taking Union artillery and infantry fire as they advanced, Huger's men slowed and then stopped, finding a measure of protection in a nearby bluff. They had fought to about 75 yards (69 m) of the Union line but could go no further. Huger's last brigade under Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom managed to get within 20 yards (18 m) by 6 p.m. but also fell back after receiving heavy casualties in the Confederate defeat.Following the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, Gen. Lee began to reorganize his army and eliminate ineffective division commanders, including Huger. His actions since joining the army \"left much to be desired\" according to military biographer Ezra J. Warner. Other historians have also criticized Huger throughout this time: Brendon A. Rehm summarized his battle performance as \"not notably successful\" and John C. Fredriksen stated Huger was \"lethargic\" during Seven Pines as well as moved \"sluggishly\" during the Seven Days fights. Furthermore, the Confederate Congress held Huger accountable for the defeat at Roanoke Island. His dilatory performance also appears to have been blamed on his rather advanced age; at nearly 57, he was well above the average age of most field officers. As a result, Huger was relieved of command on July 12, 1862 along with Maj. Gen. Theophilus Holmes, another aging, ineffective division commander. and that fall was ordered to serve in the Trans-Mississippi Department. Trans-Mississippi service After the Seven Days Battles, Huger was assigned to be assistant Inspector General of artillery and ordnance for the Army of Northern Virginia. He held this post from his relief on June 12 until August, when he was sent to the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department. Considered too old for field command, he would spend the remainder of the war in administrative duties. Huger was made the department's inspector of artillery and ordnance on August 26, and then was promoted to command of all ordnance within the department in July 1863. This position he held until the end of the American Civil War in 1865, when he surrendered along with Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith and the rest of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi forces. Huger was paroled from Shreveport, Louisiana, on June 12 of that same year and returned to civilian life.Huger's Trans-Mississippi service in staff positions has been rated positively by historians. Ezra J. Warner believed this area of military service was \"his proper sphere\" and summarized Huger's overall performance there as: \"These duties he energetically and faithfully discharged until the close of the war, most of the time in the Trans-Mississippi service.\" Likewise John C. Fredriksen states \"He functioned capably in this office until 1863, when he rose to chief of ordnance in the Trans-Mississippi Department until the end of the war.\" Postbellum After the war, Huger became a farmer in North Carolina and then in Fauquier County, Virginia, finally returning in poor health to his home in Charleston, South Carolina. He was also a member of Aztec Club of 1847, a social club formed just after the Mexican\u2013American War by army officers. Huger served as its vice president from 1852 to 1867. He died in Charleston in December 1877 and was buried at Green Mount Cemetery located in Baltimore, Maryland.

He was the first chair of Euratom and was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1963.  Biography Born at the Palace of Versailles, he was one of seven children born to his parents, and their only son to live past the age of 5. At the age of 8, on 30 June 1704, he was baptised. Held at Versailles, King Louis XIV had Mary of Modena as the guest of honour at the ceremony; Mary was the widow of the exiled King James II of England. Louis was often described as being \"hideous\"; he was humpbacked and very unattractive.At the age of 13 his father died in Paris (22 February 1709) and Louis Armand succeeded to the Conti title and wealth, although there was no real principality. On 1 January 1711, Louis Armand was made a knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit. On 9 July 1713, Louis Armand married his maternal first cousin, Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Bourbon, known as Mademoiselle de Bourbon. Another proposed bride was her sister, Louise Anne de Bourbon. Louise \u00c9lisabeth was the daughter of Louis III, Prince of Cond\u00e9 and Louise-Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon, a legitimised daughter of King Louis XIV and his famous mistress, Madame de Montespan. The event, also took place at Versailles and was part of a double marriage; on the same day, his oldest sister, Marie Anne de Bourbon, married Louis Henri I, Prince of Cond\u00e9, known as the Duke of Bourbon. In the end, Louise \u00c9lisabeth's brother Charles, Count of Charolais, even proposed to Charlotte Agla\u00e9, who is said to have considered the proposal but refused. Charlotte Agla\u00e9 herself married the Duke of Modena in 1720, in the presence of Louis Armand and Louis \u00c9lisabeth. The marriage of Louis Armand and Louise \u00c9lisabeth would later become stormy. Louise \u00c9lisabeth was known to have been unfaithful to her husband, a liaison with the handsome Philippe Charles de La Fare was well known at court. In August 1716, Louis Armand caught Smallpox; it was Louise \u00c9lisabeth who would nurse him until his recovery. Louise \u00c9lisabeth later caught the illness herself but survived the disease. It was at this time that Louis Armand found out about Louise \u00c9lisabeth's affair with Monsieur de La Fare. He is reported to have hurt his wife to the point that she had to see a doctor on two separate occasions. Louise \u00c9lisabeth stayed at the Palais Bourbon which was her mothers private home in Paris. She also stayed at a convent in the capital. At the birth of their second son in 1717, Louis Armand said to her that he did not care for the child as he could not have been his; in turn, the proud Louise \u00c9lisabeth replied that she did not care for the child either because he was his.Louise \u00c9lisabeth and Louis Armand had to go to many court hearings in Paris. In 1725, she consented to return to the Prince of Conti, who had her confined to the Ch\u00e2teau de l'Isle-Adam. She was able later, however, to convince him to allow her to return to Paris in order to give birth to her daughter. It was while in Paris she gave birth to their only daughter Louise Henriette. He was treated with great liberality by King Louis XIV, and also by the Regent, Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. Louis Armand was a prominent supporter of the financial schemes of John Law, by which he made large sums of money. It was during the Regency of 1715\u20131723, Louis Armand was appointed a member of the Regency council itself as well as a member of the Council of War. In April 1717 he received the government of the Poitou region of France. This appointment came with a wage of 45,000 Livres. He served under Marshal Villars in the War of the Spanish Succession, but he lacked the soldierly qualities of his father. Louis Armand died at the H\u00f4tel de Conti (quai Conti) in Paris due to a \"chest swelling\".

He never retired, dying in office.  Education and career Keith was born and grew up in Detroit, Michigan, where he graduated from Northwestern High School in 1939. Keith then moved on to West Virginia State College where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1943. He served in the United States Army from 1943 to 1946. He then attended Howard University School of Law where he received a Bachelor of Laws in 1949, and Wayne State University Law School where he received a Master of Laws in 1956. He was in the private practice of law in Detroit from 1950 to 1967. He was an attorney in the Office of the Friend of the Court in Detroit from 1951 to 1955. In 1964 Keith was elected co-chair of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission with John Feikens and was a key player in the tumultuous times following the Detroit race riots. Personal Keith married Rachel Boone in 1953 and they had three daughters. Rachel died on January 4, 2007. Keith died on April 28, 2019 at his home in Detroit, at the age of 96. The cause was complications from leukemia and cardiovascular disease. Federal judicial service At the suggestion of United States Senator Philip Hart, Keith was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on September 25, 1967, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan vacated by Judge Thomas Patrick Thornton. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 12, 1967, and received his commission the same day. He served as Chief Judge from 1975 to 1977. His service was terminated on November 22, 1977, due to his elevation to the Sixth Circuit.Keith was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on September 28, 1977, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated by Judge Wade H. McCree. He was confirmed by the Senate on October 20, 1977, and received his commission on October 21, 1977. He was a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1975 to 1978. He assumed senior status on May 1, 1995. Memberships and honors In 1974, Keith was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP. Keith is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. In 2008, Keith received an honorary doctorate in law (Legum Doctor) from Harvard University. Notable cases In United States v. Sinclair (1971), Keith famously ruled that Nixon's Attorney General John N. Mitchell had to disclose the transcripts of illegal wiretaps that Mitchell had authorized without first obtaining a search warrant. Keith's decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's landmark decision in United States v. U.S. District Court (1972) (also known as \"the Keith case\") contributed in 1978 to president Jimmy Carter signing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). That decision is commemorated as a \"Michigan Legal Milestone\" called \"the Uninvited Ear\" and erected by the State Bar of Michigan.In Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft (2002), Keith, writing for a unanimous panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, found that absolute closure of deportation hearings in \"special interest\" cases was unconstitutional. Under the authorization of Attorney General John Ashcroft, Chief Immigration Judge Michael Creppy told all immigration judges to close to the public and media all hearings associated with immigration that were thought to be related to September 11 investigation. These cases were advised to be handled in seclusion, \"closed off from the public\", and were held in special interest of national security. Officials terminated public records of the case and removed them from the court's docket. This rule of closed deportation hearings became known as the \"Creppy directive\". Members of the press and public filed two of the cases challenging the Government's closure of removal proceedings. The plaintiffs in those cases are (1) the Detroit Free Press, Inc. and Herald Co., Inc. (d\/b\/a the Ann Arbor News) (the \"free press plaintiffs\") and (2) the Detroit News, Inc., Congressman John Conyers, Jr., and Metro Times, Inc. (the \"Detroit News plaintiffs\"); the two are collectively the \"newspaper plaintiffs\". The third case, filed by the ACLU of Michigan representing Rabih Haddad (\"Haddad\"), one of the men against whom the government had instituted removal proceedings stated that Haddad, a native of Lebanon, resided in Ann Arbor, Michigan, off and on since 1988. Haddadd came to the United States in 1998 on six-month tourist visas. On December 14, 2001, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") took Haddad into custody for overstaying his visa and initiated removal proceedings in Detroit before Immigration Judge Elizabeth Hacker. Prominent clerks Keith has been called a father-figure to former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, who previously clerked for him. He administered the oath of office to her in both 2003 and 2007. Former law clerks also include: Lani Guinier, the first African-American woman to gain tenure at Harvard Law School Judge Eric L.

Background Born in east Belfast, she attended Mersey Street Primary and Bloomfield Collegiate School. She graduated from Queen's University of Belfast with a degree in civil engineering in 1994, worked in a structural engineering consultancy for two years, held a research and training post at Queen's University for three years, and then went back into environmental and hydraulic engineering consultancy for four years. Political career She first took political office in 2001 when she was elected to Belfast City Council for the Victoria ward. In 2003 Long was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly for Belfast East, succeeding her fellow party member John Alderdice. In 2006 she was named deputy leader of her party. In 2007 she more than doubled the party's vote in the constituency, being placed second ahead of the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. The overall UUP vote, however, was 22%. At 18.8%, her vote share was higher than that for Alderdice in 1998. On 1 June 2009 she was elected as Lord Mayor of Belfast, defeating William Humphrey (Democratic Unionist Party) by 26 votes to 24 in a vote at a council meeting. She became the second woman to hold the post, after Grace Bannister (1981\u201382). Member of Parliament On 6 May 2010 she defeated Peter Robinson, First Minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the DUP, to become Member of Parliament (MP) for Belfast East in the House of Commons. She became the first MP elected to Westminster for the Alliance Party (previously, Stratton Mills, a former Ulster Unionist Party MP, had changed parties to Alliance). Long also became the first Liberal-affiliated MP elected to Westminster in Northern Ireland since James Brown Dougherty in Londonderry City in 1914. Despite the close relationship between the Alliance Party and the Liberal Democrats, Long did not sit with the coalition government nor take the coalition whip and was not a member of the Liberal Democrats.On 10 December 2012, Long received a number of death threats and a petrol bomb was thrown inside an unmarked police car guarding her constituency office. This violence erupted as a reaction by Ulster loyalists to the decision by Alliance Party members of Belfast City Council to vote in favour of restricting the flying of the Union flag at Belfast City Hall to designated days throughout the year, which at the time constituted 18 specific days.In 2015, Long lost her seat in the Commons to Gavin Robinson of the DUP, as a result of a five-party unionist pact in the constituency which saw the UUP, UKIP, TUV and PUP all stand aside in favour of Robinson. Return to the Northern Ireland Assembly In January 2016, Long announced that she would return as an Assembly candidate in the 2016 elections having been nominated in place of incumbent Judith Cochrane. She was subsequently elected on the first count with 14.7% of first-preference votes. Following her return to the Assembly, Long assumed positions on the Committee for Communities, the All Party Group on Fairtrade, the All Party Group for Housing, and chaired the All Party Group on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.In August 2016, Long called for Sinn F\u00e9in's M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Muilleoir to stand aside as Minister of Finance during an investigation of the Stormont Finance Committee's handling of its Nama inquiry, while \u00d3'Muilleoir was a committee member. This followed allegations that his party had \"coached\" loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson prior to his appearance before the committee.In November 2016, Long criticised Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP for delaying the publication of a working group report on abortion, which recommended legislative changes in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, calling on the Executive \"to act without further delay to help women who decide to seek a termination in these very difficult circumstances\". Leader of the Alliance Party On 26 October 2016, Long was elected Alliance leader unopposed following the resignation of David Ford. In the first manifesto released under her leadership, Long affirmed her commitment to building a \"united, open, liberal and progressive\" society. Her party's legislative priorities were revealed to include the harmonisation and strengthening of equality and anti-discrimination measures, the introduction of civil marriage equality, development of integrated education and a Northern Ireland framework to tackle climate change.In the 2017 Assembly election, Long topped the poll in Belfast East and was returned to the Assembly with 18.9% of first-preference votes. The election was widely viewed as a success for Alliance, with the party increasing its vote share by 2 percentage points and retaining all of its seats in a smaller Assembly. The party subsequently held the balance of power at Stormont.Alliance targeted two seats in South and Belfast East in the 2017 general election. During the campaign, Long reaffirmed her support for a People's Vote, marriage equality, Votes at 16 and greater transparency surrounding political donations. She also pledged to oppose any rollback of the Human Rights Act.Following the collapse of talks to restore devolution in February 2018, Long reiterated her view that the pay of MLAs should be cut in the absence of a functioning Executive. In March 2018, Alliance launched its 'Next Steps Forward' paper, outlining a number of proposals aimed at breaking the deadlock and Stormont. At the 2019 Alliance Party Conference, she accused Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley of an \"appalling dereliction of duty\" over the ongoing stalemate, saying that she had made \"no concerted effort to end this interminable drift despite it allegedly being her top priority\".In the 2019 local elections, Alliance saw a 65% rise in its representation on councils. Long hailed the \"incredible result\" as a watershed moment for politics in Northern Ireland.Long was elected to the European Parliament as a representative for Northern Ireland in May 2019 with 18.5% of first-preference votes, the best ever result for Alliance. She was subsequently replaced in the Assembly by M\u00e1ire Hendron, a founding member of the party and former deputy lord mayor of Belfast. She then replaced Hendron in the Assembly with effect from 9 January 2020. Having served as a local councillor, MLA, MP and MEP, Long is the only active politician in Northern Ireland to have served in every elected position, as well as having served as a mayor, party leader, deputy leader, and a minister. In March 2022, Long told the Alliance Party Conference that \"some politicians are addicted to crisis and conflict and simply not up to the job of actually governing\". Long led Alliance into the 2022 Assembly election on a platform of integrated education, health reform, a Green New Deal, tackling paramilitarism and reform of the Stormont institutions. Minister of Justice On 11 January 2020, following the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly after three years of stalemate, Long was elected Minister of Justice in the Northern Ireland Executive. On 28 January, Long announced that she would progress new domestic abuse legislation through the Assembly which would make coercive control a criminal offence in Northern Ireland. In June 2020, Long commissioned a review into the support available for prison officers following concerns about absence rates. That same month, she announced her intention to introduce unexplained wealth orders in Northern Ireland to target paramilitary and criminal finances.In November 2020, Long said she was seriously reconsidering her position within the Executive following the DUP's deployment of a cross-community vote to prevent an extension of COVID-19 regulations. She told BBC News, \"I have asked people to desist from this abuse of power because it will make my position in the executive unsustainable.\" Personal life Long is a member of Bloomfield Presbyterian Church. Following the Church's decision to exclude those in same-sex relationships from being full members, she expressed \"great concern\" and stated that she \"didn't know\" if she would remain a member herself. She is married to Michael Long, an Alliance councillor on Belfast City Council and former Lord Mayor of Belfast, and son of the engineer Professor Adrian Long. Long and her husband are the first husband and wife to have both served as Lord Mayors of Belfast.In August 2017, Long revealed that she had been suffering from endometriosis and would undergo surgery for the condition.

Club career Early career Gillespie was born in Larne, County Antrim. His first years were spent in Islandmagee, County Antrim where he attended Whitehead Primary School. He later moved to Bangor, County Down where he attended Rathmore Primary School and Bangor Grammar School. He was scouted playing for St Andrews FC from Belfast, and was the first professional footballer to come from this club. Manchester United Gillespie signed for Manchester United on leaving school in the summer of 1991, being a member of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 1992. Also in that team were Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Gary Neville and Robbie Savage. Gillespie made his first senior appearance for Manchester United in the 1992\u201393 season. He scored on his debut against Bury in a 2\u20130 FA Cup third round triumph on 5 January 1993. He was issued with the number 31 shirt for the 1993\u201394 season with the introduction of squad numbers, but did not play any first team games and was loaned to Division Three club Wigan Athletic, scoring four goals in eight games. Occasional appearances for United followed in 1994\u201395, but he was never able to displace Andrei Kanchelskis as United's first-choice right winger. He moved to Newcastle United on 10 January 1995, as a \u00a31 million component in the \u00a37 million deal (\u00a36 million cash) which took Andrew Cole to Old Trafford. Gillespie had scored one of United's goals against Newcastle in the 2\u20130 victory at Old Trafford. This meant that he had scored twice for Manchester United in three seasons as a professional. Newcastle United On 20 August 1995, the News of the World carried reports that Gillespie was subject of an approach from Alex Ferguson to return to Manchester United to fill the gap on the right wing being left by the sale of Andrei Kanchelskis to Everton, but the return to Old Trafford never happened and United instead turned to up-and-coming youngster David Beckham to occupy that position. 18 years later, Gillespie confirmed that Ferguson did contact him regarding a possible return to Manchester United, but claims that he heard nothing more about the prospective transfer after that original telephone conversation with his former manager.Gillespie stayed at Newcastle for three-and-a-half years and during this time he played 143 games, including 15 European ties (in both the Champions League and UEFA Cup) and scored 13 goals. In both the 1995\u201396 and 1996\u201397 seasons he helped Newcastle to finish second in the Premier League (runners up to Gillespie's former club, Manchester United, on both occasions), being a key member of \"The Entertainers\". On the first occasion, the Magpies very nearly beat Gillespie's old club to the title, having been 10 points ahead of them by Christmas 1995 before a dismal final three months of the season saw the title sealed by Gillespie's former team mates. Initially injured from a Phil Neville tackle in a 0\u20132 defeat at Old Trafford on 27 December 1995 causing him to miss the following three games, at the end of the 1995\u201396 season Gary Lineker, then a BBC pundit, said that one of the main reasons that Newcastle lost out on the title race was because they dropped Gillespie (who had been supplying Newcastle's forwards with a stream of good crosses) for several key games in the latter part of the season.In September 1996, Gillespie was outed as a problem gambler by The Sun. He then accepted a \u00a35,000 payment by the same tabloid to publicly thank them for helping out his problem. Gillespie has publicly said that he would bet on matches involving his own team, and once lost \u00a352,000 because he had bet on Newcastle scored a late goal and he had bet on them beating Stoke City by under four goals.In his final full season at Newcastle, the 1997\u201398 season, Gillespie assisted two of Faustino Asprilla's three goals in a 3\u20132 Champions League victory over FC Barcelona on 17 September 1997. He also scored what he later claimed was his best goal for the club when playing up front due to an injury crisis at home to Blackburn Rovers in 1-1 draw on 25 October 1997. He also helped Newcastle to reach the FA Cup final. However, a foot injury sustained in a 0\u20132 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on 25 April 1998 meant, despite a fitness test, he was not in the squad for the final and Newcastle lost to Arsenal. Despite being in manager Kenny Dalglish's plans, the following pre-season Gillespie failed a medical at Middlesbrough but eventually departed Tyneside in a \u00a32.3 million move to Blackburn Rovers following the appointment of Ruud Gullit as manager and a final appearance in a 2\u20132 draw at Middlesbrough on 6 December 1998. Blackburn Rovers Gillespie was unable to help Blackburn avoid relegation in 1998\u201399, and manager Brian Kidd was sacked later in the year. Gillespie was initially out of favour with new manager Graeme Souness, and another loan spell at Wigan Athletic brought his total appearances for Athletic to 15, from which he scored four goals. He returned to the Blackburn side for the final months of the 2000\u201301 season, as the club gained promotion back to the Premier League. He also started in the 2002 Football League Cup Final, setting up a goal by Matt Jansen in the 2\u20131 victory over Tottenham Hotspur. Five seasons at Ewood Park brought 137 appearances and 6 goals. Leicester City Gillespie moved to newly promoted Leicester City on a free transfer on 8 July 2003, signing a two-year contract. He played 48 games and scored two goals in two seasons. In March 2004, Gillespie and teammates Frank Sinclair and Paul Dickov were held in a prison cell for a week in La Manga, Spain, while charges were made against six more Leicester players. All nine men were cleared when forensic tests proved that none of them had any contact with the three women who accused them. Sheffield United Gillespie signed for Sheffield United on 5 August 2005, signing a one-year contract. This was then extended to June 2007 a month later. In his first season at the club, Gillespie played a role in Sheffield United's successful promotion campaign to the Premier League. Gillespie's most memorable goal for Sheffield United came against Charlton, where he scored the winner in the 88th minute with a stunning volley from 25 yards. This goal was also a nominee for the December Goal of the Month competition, which Paul Scholes eventually won. On 20 January 2007, during a Premier League match against Reading at the Madejski Stadium, Gillespie was sent off for violent conduct, \"throwing an elbow in the direction of\" Reading's Stephen Hunt, \"within 10 seconds\" of coming on as a substitute - play had not even restarted following the substitution. As he made his way off the pitch, Gillespie \"threw another punch\" at Hunt. He submitted a transfer request soon afterwards, but in July of that year Gillespie recanted and signed a new two-year contract.In July 2008, he limped out of a pre-season friendly at Bury and missed the start of the 2008\u201309 season. Having regained fitness he was unable to regain a first team place and was eventually loaned out to Charlton Athletic. He made only six appearances for the Addicks before being recalled to Bramall Lane as cover for mounting injuries.Despite being recalled to Sheffield United, Gillespie failed to make another appearance and on 30 January 2009 his contract was terminated by mutual consent. He went to Bradford City with whose manager Stuart McCall; Gillespie had been a teammate at Sheffield United. However, McCall insisted Gillespie was only training with the club to stay fit and help out the younger players, and not on trial. Bradford City Gillespie impressed McCall during training and told the manager he was very keen to gain match experience; as a result, Gillespie signed for Bradford City in March for the rest of the 2008\u201309 season. Gillespie was an unused substitute in their 1\u20130 defeat to Exeter City and so had to wait for his debut which came as a second-half substitute with City already 4\u20131 down to AFC Bournemouth three days later. After just three appearances Gillespie was not offered a long-term deal by Bradford City. In the summer of 2009 he had a trial with Hungarian side Ferencv\u00e1ros and had been linked with a move to the IFA Premiership. Glentoran In 2009, Gillespie made a shock move to the east Belfast club, Glentoran. It was believed that Gillespie's agents approached Glentoran. He made his debut for Glentoran against Ballymena United in the league, he had previously played for Glentoran the night before for the reserves against Ballymena; Glentoran lost 2\u20131 in his 1st senior appearance for, at the time, the current league champions. In June 2010, the club announced that Gillespie was to leave after just one season after he and the club failed to agree terms on a new deal. Shamrock Rovers In August 2010, Gillespie's former international teammate Michael O'Neill invited him to play in a friendly for Shamrock Rovers in a reserve game against his first club, Manchester United. Darlington In October 2010, Gillespie joined up with Conference National side Darlington, later signing with the club. He made three appearances before being released on 23 December 2010. Longford Town On 24 March 2011, Gillespie signed for League of Ireland First Division side Longford Town. Gillespie made his debut from the bench in a local derby against Athlone Town on 2 April with Gillespie's new side coming out on top by two goals to nil. He was named on the League of Ireland First Division team of the season for 2012 and was also awarded Longford Town F.C. player of the year, as they lost in the promotion playoffs to Waterford United. Gillespie scored his one and only Longford goal in May 2013 against Cobh Ramblers. Injuries hampered Gillespie during the 2013 season and he announced his retirement prior to the season's end. His final appearance was as a substitute during Longford's 3\u20131 victory at home to Finn Harps on 7 September 2013. FC Mindwell Gillespie came out of retirement in 2020, aged 45, to play for newly-formed Mid-Ulster Football League side FC Mindwell, a team set up to raise awareness of mental health issues. International career Gillespie is currently sixth place in the list of appearances for Northern Ireland with 86 caps. He made his debut in September 1994 in a 2\u20131 home defeat by Portugal. He played an important role in his country's 3\u20132 qualifying win against Spain at Windsor Park on 6 September 2006. Gillespie was investigated by the Irish FA for his involvement in a fracas with George McCartney on the trip back home from a game in Iceland in September 2007. He was not involved with the Northern Ireland set-up since being omitted from the squad that faced San Marino in February 2009. His final cap was won in a 2\u20130 defeat by Hungary at Windsor Park in November 2008. International goals Scores and results list Northern Ireland's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Gillespie goal. Personal life Gillespie was declared legally bankrupt on 1 October 2010 by the Belfast High Court. In 2013, he released his autobiography, How Not to Be a Football Millionaire, in which he describes his gambling addiction, estimating he lost more than \u00a37 million. Reviewer Robbie Meredith of When Saturday Comes wrote that \"It is too cliched to claim that Gillespie achieves redemption at the end of his tale. Rather he gains the uncertain gift of a better understanding of himself. In doing so, he provides a compelling glimpse into the dark void inherent in the modern age of adrenaline-fuelled football celebrity\". Gillespie has supported the Gambling with Lives charity, which calls for tighter regulation of gambling and offers support for people with gambling problems.

He was a knight of the Order of Santiago.","public_knowledge":"Francisco de Tello de Guzm\u00e1n (sometimes Francisco Tello de Guzm\u00e1n; 1532-April 1603) was Spanish governor of the Philippines from July 14, 1596 to May 1602. He was a knight of the Order of Santiago.  Early life and appointment as governor Francisco de Tello de Guzm\u00e1n was a native of Seville. He became a knight in the Order of Santiago and treasurer of the India House of Trade. He was named governor and captain general of the Philippines by a royal decree dated November 26, 1595. He entered Manila and took up his position on July 14, 1596. As governor Despatches from New Spain ordering the reestablishment of the Audiencia of Manila (which had been dissolved some years before) arrived in Manila in May 1598. Governor Tello was named its governor; Doctor Antonio de Morga and Licentiates Christoval Telles Alma\u00e7an and Alvaro Rodriguez Zambrano, auditors; and Licentiate Geronymo de Salazar, fiscal. This Audiencia was constituted May 5, 1598. Fray Ignacio de Sanctiva\u00f1es, the first archbishop of Manila arrived by the same ships, in May 1598, but he died of dysentery in August of that year. The first suffragan bishops also began arriving in 1598. One of these was Fray Pedro de Agurto, bishop of Sanctisimo Nombre de Jesus, was a native of New Spain. The Jesuit seminary of San Jos\u00e9 was founded in 1601. In 1598, Tello sent Juan Zamudio to China in order to establish a trade port there like the Portuguese did in Macau. This resulted in El Pi\u00f1al being granted to the Spanish, but the Portuguese in Macau reacted violently and attacked the Spanish there. El Pi\u00f1al was abandoned two years later. On December 14, 1600, a Spanish fleet under the command of Doctor Antonio de Morga fought two Dutch pirate ships at Cavite. In an intense, six-hour hand-to-hand battle between the two flagships (the San Diego and the Mauritius), the Spanish ship was sunk and defenders of the Dutch ship were mostly killed and the ship set on fire. It did, however, manage to limp to Borneo with a skeleton crew. (This is based on the account of Morga himself. The Dutch account accused him of incompetence and cowardice.) The San Diego lost perhaps 350 sailors and soldiers. Also in 1600, two merchant ships left Manila for New Spain: the flagship Sancta Margarita, with Juan Mart\u00ednez de Guillestigui as general, and the San Geronimo, under Don Fernando de Castro. On their way, both ships met with storms in the latitude of 38\u00b0 and at 600 leguas from the Philippines, and suffered great hardship. After nine months at sea, after many of the men had died and much of the merchandise had been thrown overboard, the San Geronimo put back to the Philippines, off the islands of Catenduanes, outside of the channel of Espiritu Santo, and there was wrecked, although the crew was saved. The flagship \"Sancta Margarita, after the death of the general and most of the crew, ported at the Ladrones Islands (Guam) and anchored at Zarpana. There natives who went to the ship, seeing it so abandoned and battered, boarded and took possession of it, and of its goods and property. The few men whom they found alive, they took away to their settlements, where they killed some and apportioned others to various villages, where they maintained them and gave them better treatment. The war in Mindanao Shortly after he had taken over the government, Tello received news of the death of Estevan Rodr\u00edguez de Figueroa in Mindanao. Juan de la Xara wrote that he had taken over the conquest and pacification of the island that Rodr\u00edguez had been in charge of. However, it was learned that Xara was depriving the heirs of Rodr\u00edguez of their inheritance, and that he intended to ignore the authority of the governor in Manila. When Xara left his camp and traveled to Oton, he was arrested and sent to Manila for trial. He died during the course of the trial. Tello sent Captain Toribio de Miranda to Mindanao, and he reestablished royal authority in the camp of Xara. Mindanao at this time was only partially conquered. Rodr\u00edguez de Figueroa had signed an agreement to complete the conquest at his own expense, but with his death the agreement lapsed. The treasury of the colony was depleted, but Governor Tello nevertheless decided to take over the conquest at government expense. He sent General Juan Roquillo to take charge. Upon his arrival, Roquillo took command of the Spanish camp and fleet, which he found in Tampacan. He confirmed the peace and friendship with the chiefs and people of Tampacan and Lumaguan, restored and set in better order the Spanish settlement and fort, and began to make preparation for the war against Buhahayen. He spent many days in making a few incursions into their land and attacks on their forts, but without any notable result. The enemy were many and all good soldiers, with plenty of arquebuses and artillery, and had fortified themselves in a strong position. They had many other fortifications inland and went from one to the other with impunity, whenever they wished, and greatly harassed the Spaniards, who were little used to so swampy a country. The latter found themselves short of provisions without the possibility of getting them in the country on account of the war. Don Juan Ronquillo, seeing that the war was advancing very slowly and with little result, and that the camp was suffering, drew up a report of it. He wrote to inform Governor Tello that it would be better to withdraw the camp from Mindanao River, so that it might not perish; and that a presidio could be established on the same island in the port of La Caldera, which could be left fortified, in order not to abandon this enterprise entirely, and so that their friends of Tampacan and Lumaguan might be kept hostile to the people of Buhahayen. Meanwhile, he and the rest of the camp and fleet would return to Manila, if permitted, for which he requested the governor to send him an order quickly. Upon the receipt of this despatch, Governor Don Francisco Tello ordered Don Juan Ronquillo to withdraw with his whole camp from Mindanao River. He was ordered first to make a great effort to chastise the enemy in Buhahayen, and then to burn the Spanish settlement and fort and go to La Caldera, fortify it, and leave there a sufficient garrison with artillery, boats, and provisions for its maintenance and service. Then he was to return to Manila with the rest of his men, after telling their friends in Tampacan that the Spaniards would shortly return to the river better equipped and in greater numbers. Before this could be completed, however, the forces of Buhahayen, reinforced by a fleet and 1,000 soldiers from Terrenate, attacked the Spanish in their camp. In intense fighting, sometimes hand to hand, the Spanish routed the attackers, killing many, taking many prisoners, and capturing or burning most of the boats. As soon as possible after this, the Spaniards attacked the settlements and forts of Buhahayen which such effect that the enemy, seeing themselves hard pressed and without anyone to help them, sent proposals of peace to Ronquillo. The outcome was their rendering recognition and homage to the Spanish, and pledging friendship with Tampacan, their ancient enemy. Thereupon the war was apparently ended, provisions were now to be had, and the Spaniards with little precaution crossed and went about the country wherever they wished. The people of Buhahayen promised to dismantle all their forts immediately, for that was one of the conditions of peace. When the Spaniards returned to their fort and settlement at Tampacan, Don Juan Ronquillo immediately sent despatches to Governor Don Francisco Tello, informing him of the different turn that the enterprise had taken. The governor immediately sent a despatch countermanding his first order, but it arrived too late. The Spanish abandoned and burned their base on Mindanao River and left for Manila, leaving only a garrison of 100 soldiers at La Caldera. The governor sent to arrest General Ronquillo on the road before he entered Manila, intending to proceed against him by law for having withdrawn the camp and army from Mindanao River without awaiting the orders he should have expected after the favorable turn of affairs. However, General Ronquillo was set at liberty on showing a private letter from the governor, which the latter had sent him separately with the first instructions, to the effect that he should return to Manila with his troops in any event, because they were needed in the islands for other purposes; and because of this letter Don Juan had determined not to await the second order. This partial withdrawal of the Spanish resulted in their opposition gaining considerable strength. The king of Jolo Island, a vassal of the Spanish, soon revolted. The Spanish made an unsuccessful effort to reconquer Jolo in 1602. The rebellion of Magalat At about the same time, Magalat, a chief of Cagayan, was arrested in Manila for inciting rebellion against the Spanish. He was released on the importunities of some Dominican priests, and returned to Cagayan. There he incited the whole country to revolt. He was said to have committed cruel murders and injuries even upon the natives themselves, if they refused to rise against the Spaniards. He soon controlled the countryside, and the Spanish were unable to leave the city. Governor Tello sent Pedro de Chaves from Manila with troops. They had good success against the rebels, capturing and executing several leaders. Magalat himself was killed in his fortified home by his own people, who had been promised a reward. Martyrdom of Franciscans in Japan In 1596, the galleon San Felipe laden with Philippine goods sailed for New Spain, but because of severe weather it was forced to land in Japan, in territory controlled by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The Japanese confiscated the merchandise and imprisoned the Spaniards. Fray Pedro Baptista, superior of the Franciscan religious residing in Miako (Kyoto), attempted to mediate with the authorities, but without success. In fact he so angered Hideyoshi, that the latter ordered the suppression of Christianity. Twenty-six Christians were crucified on February 5, 1597 in Nagasaki. Besides Fray Pedro Baptista, they included Fray Martin de Aguirre, Fray Felipe de las Casas, Fray Gon\u00e7alo, Fray Francisco Blanco, Fray Francisco de San Miguel. In all there were 26 Franciscan and Jesuit priests and Japanese lay converts, including two boys. Their right ears were cut off, and they were paraded through the streets of Miako and through those of the cities of Fugimen, Usaca, and Sacai, to the great grief and sorrow of all Christians who saw their sufferings.[1]The Spaniards of the San Felipe eventually made it back to Manila, in various Japanese and Portuguese ships, but with a total loss of the merchandise they carried. Governor Tello sent an ambassador to Hideyoshi bearing gifts (including an elephant) and also a protest at the treatment of the religious and the sailors, and a demand for the return of the goods the San Felipe had been carrying. Hideyoshi was delighted with the gifts and expressed a desired for friendship with the Spanish. However, he claimed he was unable to return the merchandise because it had already been distributed. Francisco de Tello de Guzman left office in May 1602. He died in Manila in April of the following year.

As a member of the Stock Aitken Waterman songwriting team, he wrote and produced many hit singles. He is the owner of significant collections of both historic and commercial railway locomotives and rolling stock.  Early life Peter Alan Waterman was born in Stoke Heath, Coventry, Warwickshire. He was educated at Whitley Abbey Comprehensive School until he left in 1962 to work for British Railways. He became a steam locomotive fireman based at Wolverhampton (Stafford Road) depot. In 2002 he said of his time working for British Railways, \"I loved every minute of it. The squalor was unreal, but the camaraderie was phenomenal.\" After closure of the depot in 1963, Waterman chose to follow a career in music, being inspired by The Beatles. To supplement his income as a DJ, he became a gravedigger and then an apprentice at General Electric Company, becoming a trade union official. He also worked as a coal miner. Musical career Building a record collection through rare US imports, his DJ work began to take him across the UK, entertaining bigger crowds with a blend of rhythm and blues and soul music tunes he had sourced. Given a residency with the Mecca Leisure Group, he developed new initiatives including matin\u00e9e discos for under 18s at Coventry's Locarno club, which gave him a valuable insight into what music interested a younger audience. Waterman noticed that the younger dancers preferred records with high beats per minute and this influenced his later work. It was at the Locarno that Waterman first met Neville Staple, later to be a vocalist for The Specials \u2013 a band that Waterman would manage for a brief period. In early 2009, Waterman wrote the foreword to Staple's biography, Original Rude Boy, which was published by Aurum Press in May 2009. Waterman took up a job as an A&R man, and worked in the Philadelphia scene, which included introducing the Three Degrees to the UK. He then moved to Jamaica working with Peter Tosh and Lee Perry, and producing Susan Cadogan\u2019s reggae-crossover hit \"Hurt So Good\".In 1979, Waterman set up Loose Ends with Peter Collins, the first coming under the name 14\u201318 with a single inspired by World War I, \"Good-Bye-Ee,\" and hits with artists like Musical Youth and Nik Kershaw. He then set up his own company PWL (Pete Waterman Limited) in 1984, quickly signing producers Matt Aitken and Mike Stock, who produced the song \"Whatever I Do\" for Hazell Dean. Stock Aitken Waterman became one of the most successful musical production teams of the 1980s.Waterman has been involved in at least twenty-two UK number one singles with his acts (including Dead or Alive, Kylie Minogue, Rick Astley, Bananarama, Steps, Mel and Kim, Donna Summer, Sinitta, Cliff Richard and Jason Donovan) and he claims upwards of 500 million sales worldwide (inclusive of singles, albums, compilation inclusions, downloads, etc.). Waterman has also appeared in the Steps video \"Tragedy\". In the late-1990s, production company Celador hired Waterman to compose a song for their new quiz show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. The company felt the song unsuitable, and instead approached Keith Strachan.Waterman co-wrote and produced with Mike Stock \"That Sounds Good to Me\" by Josh Dubovie, the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest entry for the United Kingdom, which finished in last place with 10 points.Waterman was worth \u00a330 million in 2006\/07, according to The Sunday Times Rich List. Television Waterman co-presented The Hit Man and Her (1988-1992) with Michaela Strachan. He also presented a show on Radio City. Waterman has appeared as a judge on both series of Pop Idol in the UK (2001\u201303), and also Popstars: The Rivals (2002). The latter saw him become manager of the winning boy band One True Voice, who then lost the race to Christmas number 1 to the same show's winning girl group, Louis Walsh's Girls Aloud. Waterman returned as judge for the second series of Pop Idol, but was constantly critical of the eventual winner, Michelle McManus, and was openly disappointed when she won. Waterman has since said he will not appear on any similar programmes in future, and has on several occasions attacked more recent talent shows (specifically those devised by his former Pop Idol colleague, Simon Cowell). Waterman has stated that he turned down offers to participate in The X Factor, Britain's Got Talent and American Idol, citing fix allegations and being put off by unprofessional behaviour including that of Popstars: The Rivals co-judge Geri Halliwell during the show.Whilst he has kept his promise not to appear as a talent show judge, on 12 October 2008, Waterman joined his fellow ex-Pop Idol judges Neil Fox and Nicki Chapman on Peter Kay's spoof talent show Britain's Got The Pop Factor... And Possibly A New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly On Ice, a fully scripted fictional spoof on the talent show genre. The show parodied the emotional manipulation behind Cowell's shows, with Waterman memorably interrupting a funeral to tell an ousted contestant that the loss of his gran (who had died of shock when learning her grandson had been dropped from the show) would provide the sob story he needed to get him on to the show. In factual television, Waterman's interest in trains saw him present a historic self-retrospective view in Waterman on Railways for Channel Four\/the Discovery Channel. Waterman also appeared in an advert by the National Blood Service in the UK, their sixth TV advert which also features Carol Smillie and Will Carling. Waterman was one of the contestants in the 2009 series of the BBC programme Celebrity MasterChef, but was knocked out in the first round. In October 2019, Waterman appeared on The X Factor: Celebrity. Waterman was part of an all star audience during the auditions stage in Malibu at Simon Cowell\u2019s house, providing commentary critique behind the main judges, alongside Randy Jackson, Howie Mandel and songwriter Diane Warren. Eurovision Waterman wrote and produced the UK entry for the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest. This song was performed by the final three acts on Eurovision, Your Country Needs You! on 12 March 2010, Josh Dubovie was chosen to represent the UK. The song came under much criticism and William Hill's betting odds gave the song 125-1 chance that the song would win, the longest odds for a UK entry ever. In the end the song, \"That Sounds Good To Me\", came last at the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest receiving only 10 points in total. Other commercial interests Railways Waterman's main interest outside music is in railways, and he has been involved in several railway ventures. In 1988 he revived the name of the London & North Western Railway, which as a group encompassed various ventures: LNWR: a rail vehicle maintenance business, based at Crewe it had depots across the country, and was by the time of its sale the largest privately owned rail maintenance business in the country. Having accrued debts of \u00a32 million in building the business in November 2008, Waterman sold it to Arriva UK Trains. Waterman Railways: In 1994 during the opening stages of the privatisation of British Rail, Waterman bought the Special Trains Unit effective from April 1995, which ran tourist charters and special trains with six Class 47 locomotives and 200 Mark 1, Mark 2 and Mark 3 carriages. This was the first unit sold from the LNWR Group. LNWR Heritage: was the steam locomotive and carriage restoration arm, based at Crewe Heritage Centre. The company undertook the restoration of Waterman's own locomotives, as well as various complete contract locomotive renovation and boiler overhaul work. Waterman became involved from 2012 in an industry bid to create a national railway apprenticeship scheme, but the bid was rejected in Autumn 2013. In March 2014, Waterman sold the business to the Royal Scot Locomotive and General Trust.To hold his own collection of locomotives, he founded the Waterman Railway Heritage Trust, which currently owns several steam and diesel locomotives including: GWR 4575 class number 5553 GWR 5205 class number 5224 GWR 5600 class number 6634 British Rail Class 08 number 08830 (D3998) British Rail Class 25 number 25309 (D7659) 46035 Ixion 47402 Gateshead SAR NGG 16 Class number 109Waterman also has a keen interest in model railways, and is the founder of the model railway business Just Like the Real Thing, which specialises in O Gauge kits. He works closely with model-maker Laurie Lynch on this project. He continues to retain an interest in the company and regularly accompanies its sales stand to model railway exhibitions. Waterman has an extensive private collection of railway models and railway layouts, in O scale and larger gauges. He is currently building a large model of Leamington Spa railway station, in O scale and set in the 1950s. He has written several books and many magazine articles on the subject. He has said that his ability to become absorbed in making models helped him cope with grief after the death of his son.In 2007, Waterman became involved in a co-operative UK rail industry bid to create a national railway training scheme under the then Labour government, which after the Government seed funding was withdrawn from all such schemes, was halted in 2009. Waterman revealed in 2011 that he had since spent \u00a3900,000 of his own money on training apprentices at Crewe, and that outside Network Rail's own scheme, only 37 apprentices had been taken into the rail industry in 2011. In January 2015, Waterman announced the sale of the bulk of his model railway collection, to fund the training of rail apprentices in restoring his steam locomotives 5224 and 5553, which in May 2015 were moved from Crewe to Peak Rail. In April 2015, the collection sold for \u00a3627,229 at the auction in Birmingham. In July 2015, in partnership with rail engineering firm OSL, Waterman launched the Railway Exchange Training Academy (RETA) at Crewe.In June 2009, Waterman unveiled Breda LRV 1007s new name \u201cEast Lancashire railway\u201d as a tribute to the Heritage Railway at Bury tram stop.In October 2018, Waterman unveiled The Will Hay Appreciation Society's memorial bench to Will Hay, Moore Marriott and Graham Moffatt in Cliddesden, Hampshire the filming location for Buggleskelly in the railway comedy film Oh, Mr Porter!.In 2018, Waterman became president of the Railway Benefit Fund, a railway benevolent charity based in Crewe.On 20 October 2021 during a High Speed 2 site visit Waterman announced the name of one of the tunnel boring machines to be Dorothy.In 2021 and 2022, Pete Waterman also produced two different OO Gauge model layouts at Chester Cathedral. Both modelled different parts of the West Coast Main Line, with each being branded and 'Making Tracks'. In 2023, Pete Waterman (and his group of other enthusiasts nicknamed the 'Railnuts' group) will again produce a model railway, this time focusing on Milton Keynes Central railway station. Sport In addition to his passion for music and railways, Waterman is also a supporter of Walsall F.C. He is also a rugby league fan and is president of League 1 side Coventry Bears.

Reign Chueang established the Mueang Ho Kham Chiang Rung (Thai: \u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e04\u0e33\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e23\u0e38\u0e48\u0e07). Contemporary sources state that after ascending the throne, Chueang led an army to attack and occupy Muang Thaeng, which indicates that he would also have attacked Chiang Tung, the capital seat of the Tai Khoen kingdom. In Chinese Chueang is known as Pa Zhen (\u53ed\u771f).The kingdom did not last but formed the base of the Moeng L\u00fc (1180-1950). Wat Thammikaraja Located in front of the Ayutthaya Royal Palace, Wat Thammikaraja was established by Chueang, the son in law of King Sainam Phung before the Ayutthaya Period. The temple was originally known as Wat Mukkharat, and the name was later changed to honour of the founder. Although once large and grand, today\u2019s temple is somewhat diminished. However, there are many important formations inside Wat Thammikaraja. The focus point of Wat Thammikaraja is a roofless viharn, with ten brick pillars. Inside the temple you will discover a topless chedi surrounded by Angkorian style stucco lions, many which are in good condition, although some of their heads have been chopped off. There is no charge to enter Wat Thammikaraja. Plain of Jars According to a local legend, the warrior king of Chueang brought his army from Southern China and defeated the evil chieftain, King Anga. The mighty battle was followed by a mighty feast, at which hundreds of gigantic jars of wine were consumed. Chueang was apparently, as bad at tidying up as he was good at throwing parties, for he left behind all of the empty jars, of which nearly three hundred remain, scattered around the flat plains, including his own victory cup. There is little physical evidence to say that this fanciful legend does not hold at least a little truth. Major wars have been fought on the plains over the centuries, as Lao, Siamese and Vietnamese armies attempted to win control of them. Another local tradition states the jars were molded, using natural materials such as clay, sand, sugar, and animal products in a type of stone mix. This led the locals to believe the cave at Site 1 was actually a kiln, and that the huge jars were fired there and are not actually of stone. Death Later on, his enemy sent two of his soldiers to seek help from Khun Lo of the Kingdom of Sip Song Chau Tai. Upon arrival Khun Lo led his army to fight a bloody battle against Chueang and his troops. Chueang was killed on the battlefield in 1192. Legacy Chueang had extended his territory far and wide, encompassing Chiang Rung, Chiang Tung, Guangdong, Guangxi, Muang Kaeo, Muang Puan, Muang Sua, Shan and Lavo. As a consequence, these cities rulers claimed Chueang as their ancestor. Khun Chomtham brought his people and built the city of Phayao in the beginning of 11th century A.D. and enjoyed independence up until the late 13th century A.D. when Phayao had been annexed to Lanna Kingdom. Phaya Lao Meng married Nang Thep Kham Khai and had one son named Mangrai, who is the first king of Mangrai Dynasty and found Chiang Mai and moved the center of political power and development from Ngoen Yang Chiang Saen to Chiang Mai. Modern culture Chueang appears in various versions of the Phra Ruang myth. Phra Ruang, the City Father of Lavo, then a subject of the Khmer king, was obliged to send water-tribute to Angkor. Instead of using normal jars, he devised big baskets to hold a large amount of water. Later Phra Ruang escaped to Sukhothai and ordained as a monk. The Khmer king sent a warrior after him.

Two of his best-known roles were as the timid accountant Bradford Webster in the television version of The Third Man and the fussy villain, Dr. Zachary Smith, of the 1960s science-fiction series Lost in Space. Near the end of his career, he provided voices for the animated features A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2.  Early life The second of three children, Harris was born on November 6, 1914, in the Bronx, New York City, to Sam and Jennie Charasuchin, poor Russian-Jewish immigrants. His father worked in Manhattan's Garment District. The family lived in a six-story tenement, and his mother often took in boarders to make ends meet, giving them Jonathan's room and bed and relegating him to sleep on the dining room chairs. By age 12 he was working in a pharmacy as a stockboy. While there was little money for luxuries, Jonathan's father made an effort to expand his son's cultural horizons with occasional trips to see Yiddish Theatre and by listening to opera on the dining room radio. Young Jonathan was enthralled. Although he could seldom afford tickets to them, Broadway plays were also an early interest. He detested his Bronx accent and by high school cultivated an English one in its place, watching British B-movies at the arts theatre. He also developed interests in archaeology, Latin, romantic poetry and Shakespeare.In 1931, at age 16, he graduated from James Monroe High School.He legally changed his name from \"Charasuchin\" to \"Harris\" before entering college after a year-long standoff with his father, who disagreed with the change. Harris earned a degree in pharmacology from Fordham University, from which he graduated in 1936. For a time he worked in various drugstores before marrying in 1938. Career Stage Acting was Harris's first love. At age 24, he prepared a fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and tried out for a repertory company at the Millpond Playhouse on Long Island, New York and appeared in several of this troupe's plays, prior to landing a spot in the company. In 1942, Harris won the leading role of a Polish officer in the Broadway play The Heart of a City. Adopting a Polish accent, he advised the producers that his parents were originally from Poland. In 1946, he starred in A Flag Is Born, opposite Quentin Reynolds and Marlon Brando. Early television career Harris was a popular character actor for 30 years on television, making his first guest appearance on the episode \"His Name Is Jason\" on The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre in 1949. The role led to other roles in such series as: The Web, Lights Out, Goodyear Television Playhouse, two episodes of Hallmark Hall of Fame, Armstrong Circle Theatre, three episodes of Studio One, Telephone Time, Schlitz Playhouse of Stars, Climax!, Outlaws, The Twilight Zone, Bonanza, The Rogues, The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet, and Zorro, among many others. Harris returned to television, where he landed a co-starring role opposite Michael Rennie in The Third Man, from 1959 to 1965. He played Bradford Webster, an eccentric, cowardly assistant. Half the episodes were shot in London, England; the rest were filmed in Hollywood. Harris's teenaged son would visit the set at this time, and Harris did whatever he could to bridge the gap between father and son and tried to make up for lost time. Harris appeared in two 1961 episodes of The Twilight Zone, including a heroic role in \"The Silence\", in which he ended up defending a young man challenged to be silent for a whole year at a prestigious gentleman's club. Harris also portrayed Charles Dickens in a 1963 episode of Bonanza. From 1963 to 1965, Harris co-starred in the sitcom The Bill Dana Show. He played Mr. Phillips, the pompous manager of a posh hotel who is constantly at odds with his bumbling Bolivian bellhop, the Bill Dana character Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez. (A similar formula was later used in John Cleese's British hotel comedy Fawlty Towers.) Don Adams rounded out the cast as an inept house detective, a character whose distinctive mannerisms and catchphrases would soon carry over into his Maxwell Smart role on Get Smart. In similar fashion, several of Harris's catch phrases from the series, such as \"Oh, the pain!\", along with the character's mannerisms and delivery, became part of the Dr. Zachary Smith character on Lost in Space. In an apparent homage to his earlier role, Harris played a similarly pompous diplomat on Get Smart in 1970. His female assistant was named Zachary. Harris also guest-starred on The Ghost & Mrs. Muir. Dr. Zachary Smith in Lost in Space Harris was cast over two other actors for the role of Dr. Zachary Smith, the evil and conniving enemy agent on Lost in Space. The character did not appear in the original 1965 pilot episode for CBS, nor did The Robot. The series was already in production when Harris joined the cast, and starring\/co-starring billing had already been contractually assigned. Harris successfully negotiated to receive \"Special Guest Star\" billing on every episode. Bill Mumy said about Harris' role in his first episode, \"It was actually implied that this villainous character that sabotaged the mission and ended up with us was going to be killed off after a while.\" Mumy added, \"Jonathan played him as written, which was this really dark, straight-ahead villain.\" The series was successful upon its debut, and midway through the first season, Harris began to rewrite his own dialogue to add more comedy, because he felt that his strength was in portraying a comic villain. Due to Harris's popularity on the show, Irwin Allen approved his changes and gave him carte blanche as a writer. Harris subsequently stole the show, mainly via a seemingly never-ending series of alliterative insults directed toward The Robot, which soon worked their way into popular culture. Dr. Smith's best-known tropes included spitefully calling The Robot epithets such as \"bubble-headed booby\" and \"clamoring clod\". According to Bill Mumy, Harris moved quickly to develop the character: \"And we'd start working on a scene together, and he'd have a line, and then in the script I'd have my reply, and he'd say, 'No, no, no, dear boy. No, no, no. Before you say that, The Robot will say this, this, this, this, this, this, and this, and then, you'll deliver your line.'\" Mumy also said of Harris' portrayal, \"He truly, truly singlehandedly created the character of Dr. Zachary Smith that we know \u2014 this man we love to hate, coward who would cower behind the little boy, 'Oh, the pain! Save me, William!' That's all him!\" When the series was renewed for its third and final season, it remained focused on Harris' character, Dr. Smith. While the series was still solidly placed in the middle of the ratings pack, the writers appeared to run out of fresh ideas, and the show was unexpectedly cancelled in 1968 after 83 episodes, despite protests from its fans. Harris was succeeded in the role of Dr. Smith by Gary Oldman in the 1998 film version, who played the role as a more genuinely menacing and less likeable character than Harris's on television. For the 2018 reboot of Lost in Space as a Netflix original series, Parker Posey was cast as Dr. Zachary Smith, a female psychopath using a stolen identity to assume the role of the ship's psychologist. Later career In the mid-1970s, Harris starred in live-action roles in two Saturday morning children's series, Space Academy and Uncle Croc's Block, and was a well-known TV spokesman for the International House of Pancakes. He made several cameo and guest appearances during this period, including episodes of Bewitched and Sanford and Son. In a 1971 episode of Night Gallery, titled \"Since Aunt Ada Came to Stay\", Harris played Professor Nicholas Porteus, an expert on witchcraft.His last series guest-starring role was on an episode of Fantasy Island. He also starred as the character Fagan in the first episode of the science fiction series Ark II. Harris taught drama, and was Chuck Norris's vocal coach for many years. Norris credited Harris for teaching him \"how to speak\" by sticking his fingers in Norris's mouth, adding that Harris was the only person in the world he would allow to do that. Typecasting as a villain Although he was considered something of a cult icon for the role of Dr. Smith, Harris became typecast as a fey and sometimes campy villain. For example, Irwin Allen cast Harris as a villainous \"Pied Piper\" in an episode of Land of the Giants. Approached by Allen a second time, to star in a children's series, Jumbalina and the Teeners, Harris turned it down. In 1970, Harris played the role of another not-so-likeable villain, the Bulmanian Ambassador in the Get Smart episode \"How Green Was My Valet\". Harris was also a co-star, alongside Charles Nelson Reilly, in the series Uncle Croc's Block, in which Harris and Reilly portrayed malcontents producing a children's television show. Harris played the director and Reilly the titular host, Uncle Croc. In the cartoon Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light, he played lackey and sycophant to the main villain. Harris also provided the voice of the Cylon character Lucifer, an antagonist on the original 1978 ABC version of Battlestar Galactica. Voice roles Harris spent much of his later career working as a voice actor, and during it he was heard on television commercials as well as on cartoons such as Channel Umptee-3, The Banana Splits, My Favorite Martian, Rainbow Brite, Darkwing Duck, Happily Ever After, Problem Child, Spider-Man, A Bug's Life, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command and Toy Story 2. He also did voiceover work in an episode of the animated Superman series. In multiple episodes of the 1995\u20131997 cartoon series Freakazoid!, Harris reprised the cowardly Smith character and dialogue under the name \"Professor Jones,\" uttering Smith's catchphrase \"Oh, the pain!\" Emphasizing the target of the parody, numerous characters would ask him, \"Weren't you on a TV show with a robot?\" In 2001, a year prior to his death, he recorded voice work for the animated theatrical short The Bolt Who Screwed Christmas. The film, Harris's last work, was released posthumously in 2009. Lost in Space reunion appearances In 1990, Harris reunited with the cast of Lost in Space in a filmed celebration of the 25th anniversary of the series' debut, at an event attended by more than 30,000 fans. Harris made a number of other convention appearances with other cast members of Lost in Space, including a 1996 appearance at Disney World. On June 14, 1995, Harris and other cast members appeared in The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen, a television tribute to Irwin Allen, the creator of Lost in Space, who had died in 1991. Harris refused to make a cameo appearance in the 1998 motion picture version of Lost in Space, unlike many of his co-stars in the original series. He announced, \"I've never played a bit part in my life and I'm not going to start now!\" However, he did make promotional appearances for the film: Harris reprised his role as Dr. Smith in the one-hour television special Lost in Space Forever, and Harris and the rest of the surviving television cast appeared on the inside cover of an issue of TV Guide. In April 1998, Harris appeared as a guest on the talk show Biography, on which Harris fondly reminisced about his Lost in Space days, admitting he would stay up nights thinking of new alliterative insults for The Robot (\"bellicose bumpkin,\" \"bubble-headed booby\") because he enjoyed the interaction so much. For an appearance by Harris, talk show host Conan O'Brien brought one of his characters, Pimp-Bot 5000 (a \"robot pimp\"; half 1950s\u2019 robot, half 1970s\u2019 street pimp), onto the set, and Harris went into character as Dr. Smith and proceeded to insult Pimp-Bot. Shying away from his usual dry, sarcastic, and often self-deprecating style, Conan confessed to Harris that he brought him on the show just to have him insult Pimp-Bot, and that the moment made his day.In late 2002, Harris and the rest of the surviving cast of the television series were preparing to film an NBC two-hour movie titled Lost in Space: The Journey Home; however, the project was unable to proceed after Harris was found dead. Personal life Harris was married to his high school sweetheart, Gertrude Bregman, from 1938 until his death. She died of natural causes, at age 93, on August 28, 2007. They had one child, Richard, born 1942.Throughout his life, Harris had a number of hobbies \u2014 gourmet cooking, watching movies, reading, traveling, painting, magic, playing piano (he played a piano teacher in a 1968 episode of Bewitched), listening to opera, spending time with children, gardening and knitting. He also did some dancing in his spare time. Death and posthumous tributes Two months before the reunion TV movie Lost in Space: The Journey Home was set to film, Harris was taken to the hospital with what he thought was a back problem. But on November 3, 2002, he was found dead from a blood clot to the heart, just three days before his 88th birthday.Harris was interred in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, in Westwood Village, in Los Angeles. Eulogists at his funeral included long time friends: director Arthur Hiller; former 20th Century Fox television executive and producer Kevin Burns; and fellow Lost in Space castmate Bill Mumy.As a tribute to Harris, writer\/director John Wardlaw wrote an additional scene for the film The Bolt Who Screwed Christmas, which included Harris's final performance before his death. Wardlaw asked Lost in Space co-stars Bill Mumy, Angela Cartwright, and Marta Kristen to contribute their voices to the film. The three actors reunited in the recording studio on June 14, 2006. \"This was the first time they had all been together in something unrelated to Lost in Space and it was a blast. They listened to what Harris had recorded and there were laughs and some tears,\" Wardlaw stated.

Akognon along with European standout Angelo Tsagarakis led Casa Grande to the best season in school history in 2003, forming one of the best duos in Northern California basketball history. He was recruited to play for the Cougars of Washington State University, who were then coached by Dick Bennett. College career Sophomore season Akognon began the season as a starter but was soon relegated to a role off the bench. An ankle injury to starter Derrick Low forced Akognon to play more, and he responded by scoring 27 points, including the game-winning three-pointer and clinching free throws, in a 78\u201371 upset of Brandon Roy-led Washington. Akognon earned Pac-10 player of the week honors and followed that game with 25 points against the UCLA Bruins at Pauley Pavilion; most of the points came against Arron Afflalo. He earned Pontiac Pac-10 Player Honors for his winning second-half performance against the USC Trojans. Josh was also voted the Pac-10's \"Most Underrated Player\" in an article that ran in Sports Illustrated. Akognon led the team in scoring despite coming off the bench most of the year.

Josh also reached the 30-point mark five times, including a 31-point effort in the NCAA Tournament against Wisconsin.Despite an injury to his shooting hand suffered against UC-Davis, Akognon shot just under 40% from three-point range and 90% from the free throw line. Josh made 116 three-pointers and 107 free throws, a 100\u2013100 combination matched by only seven players. Akognon also doubled his career-high in steals and reached 1,000 points for his college career. Akognon's junior season also saw him achieve team and individual honors, with California State University, Fullerton tying for the regular-season title, winning the Big West Tournament and reaching the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 30 years with a 24\u20139 record. Akognon was a first team selection at the Shamrock Holiday Classic at St. Mary's, named Mid Majority Baller of the Week, named to the All-District 15 Second Team by the NABC with such players as O. J. Mayo and Kevin Love, a second team Big West selection and named MVP of the Big West Tournament where he averaged 20 points per game and hit 12 three-pointers in three games. Akognon was also named the 2007\u20132008 Africa Basket Player of the Year. Akognon announced on April 18 he was making himself eligible for the NBA Draft; after testing the waters and holding his own against some of the top 2008 draft prospects, Akognon decided on June 16 to return to the orange-and-blue for his senior season. Senior season While from a team standpoint the Titans failed to match their 2007\u201308 success, Akognon performed brilliantly in the face of countless, hounding defenses designed to slow him down. Josh was named the 2008\u201309 Big West Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year, averaging 23.9 points per game, good for 8th in the nation. Akognon broke the single season scoring record of former Titan and U.S. Olympian Leon Wood with 764 points, finished seventh overall in Titan history with 1,411 points and established a two-year scoring record for his exploits.

Football career Early career Godfrey was born in Pangbourne, Berkshire and played football for North Hampshire Schools. After leaving school he was an apprentice bricklayer and played in goal for Basingstoke Town in the Hampshire League, becoming their youngest-ever player. After a brief period on the books of Norwich City, he was signed by Southampton of the Football League Third Division South in May 1956 for a fee of \u00a3500, on the recommendation of Basingstoke's coach, Stan Clements, a former Southampton player. Southampton He started his career with the \"Saints\" in the youth team, which reached the semi-final of the FA Youth Cup in 1957. He made his reserve-team debut in March 1958 and signed a professional contract shortly after his 19th birthday. He continued to play regularly in the reserves until his first-team debut on 6 December 1958, when he took the place of John Christie who was unavailable with an injured knee for the FA Cup Second Round match at Queens Park Rangers. Godfrey acquitted himself well with a \"confident, cool, alert and agile\" performance making several fine saves and keeping a clean sheet as Southampton won the match 1\u20130.Godfrey retained his first-team place for the next five matches in the league, before Christie's return, although he was soon recalled, making 17 league appearances in his debutant season. With Christie leaving The Dell in the summer of 1959, Godfrey became first-choice 'keeper, playing the first 11 games of the 1959\u201360 season (including six victories), before an injury allowed Bob Charles to take his place. His career was then interrupted by his National Service which was spent in the Army, who he represented at football.Southampton gained promotion to the Second Division in 1960 with Ron Reynolds now in goal. In the 1960\u201361 season, Godfrey vied with Reynolds for the first-choice position in goal, making only eight appearances, but regained the No. 1 spot for 1961\u201362 after Reynolds broke his ankle in the opening match. By the start of the following season, however, Reynolds had fought his way back into the first-team and Godfrey only made six appearances.Reynolds was finally forced to retire after dislocating a shoulder in September 1963, thus allowing Godfrey to briefly become the unchallenged first-choice \"custodian\". In the summer of 1964, Southampton signed John Hollowbread from Tottenham Hotspur and Godfrey was once again second-choice, until after a run of 18 matches with only two victories, Hollowbread was dropped and Godfrey recalled. Hollowbread regained the No. 1 position for the start of the 1965\u201366 season until he sustained a knee injury in September 1965, which ended his career. Godfrey was once again recalled but after 14 matches, lost his place to Campbell Forsyth, who had been signed from Kilmarnock. Godfrey's final match for Southampton came on 4 December 1965 and shortly afterwards he was sold to Aldershot. In his seven years with Southampton, Godfrey made a total of 149 first-team appearances. Aldershot and Rochdale He joined Aldershot in December 1965 for \"a four figure fee\" but was unable to make his debut for them because he was suffering with hepatitis. His debut came on 19 March 1966, in a goalless draw with Notts County at Recreation Ground.He soon became the first-choice goalkeeper, being ever-present in the 1966\u201367 and 1967\u201368 seasons. He stayed with Aldershot for 4+1\u20442 years before he was signed by his former Southampton teammate Dick Conner at Rochdale in the summer of 1970.Godfrey spent two seasons with Rochdale, in the second of which he was the club's Player of the Season before returning to Aldershot in July 1972. He made 71 League appearances for the Spotland club.On his return to Aldershot, he was again ever-present in the 1972\u201373 season, when Aldershot were promoted from the Fourth Division for the first time. He was to remain at the Recreation Ground for another three seasons, until, with Glen Johnson now the first-choice 'keeper, he decided to retire in 1976. Coaching career Godfrey then returned to Basingstoke Town in a player-coach role, before spells as manager at Andover, Alton Town and Fleet, followed by a return to Basingstoke. In 1985, aged 45, Basingstoke were suffering an injury crisis, so Godfrey returned for one match, thus becoming their oldest-ever first-team player, having been their youngest player 30 years earlier. Later career Godfrey settled in a village south of Basingstoke where he resumed his career as a builder until his retirement.

He called Prothero \u201cthe best punctuated equilibrium researcher on the West Coast\u201d.  Biography Prothero grew up in the Glendale, California area, the son of Clifford R. Prothero (1920\u20132004), a technical illustrator for Lockheed, and Shirley M. (McDonald) Prothero (1924\u20132016), an artist and homemaker. He attended the University of California, Riverside where he studied paleontology under Dr. Michael O. Woodburne and Dr. Michael Murphy and earned Phi Beta Kappa during his junior year. He received his Ph.D. in geological sciences in 1982 from Columbia University, New York. In 1991, he appeared on the television game show Jeopardy! and defeated Ben Stein on the show Win Ben Stein's Money in 1999. He was also featured in the Mr. Deity and the Flood episode of the video series Mr. Deity. Further, he debated the Young Earth creationist Duane Gish early in his career.For 27 years, he was a member of the faculty at Occidental College and he previously taught at California Institute of Technology, Knox College, Vassar College and Columbia University where he led many undergraduate paleontological and geological field trips. He is currently a research associate in vertebrate paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Work Evolution Prothero was one of the earliest paleontologists to use the concept of palaeomagnetism in the study of continental rocks. Palaeomagnetism uses the microscopic iron within sedimentary rock to read the alignment of the magnetic field and correlate that with the known history of the polarity reversals of the earth's magnetic field. The magnetic reversals are precisely dated and consistent worldwide which allows these rocks to be studied in climate science and evolution.In addition to his research in magnetostratigraphy, another area of Prothero's research is the evolution of hoofed mammals, especially rhinos, camels, peccaries, and horses.Prothero's work on documenting evolutionary history of fossil vertebrates was cited by Richard Dawkins in his book The Greatest Show on Earth: the Evidence of Evolution. Skeptic Society founder Michael Shermer called Prothero's 2007 book, Evolution: What the Fossils Say And Why It Matters, \"the best book ever produced on the subject.\"He has also been featured as a scientific consultant and was interviewed on several television documentaries, including the Are Rhinos Dinos? episode of TLC's Paleoworld, the History Channel's Prehistoric Monsters Revealed, the episodes of National Geographic's Prehistoric Predators covering the entelodon and hyaenodon, the series Walking with Prehistoric Beasts on BBC, and the amphicyon or Bear Dog episode of Monsters Resurrected.In October 2012, Prothero appeared in his capacity as a paleontologist on Conspiracy Road Trip, a BBC television documentary in which five individuals who self-identified as Creationists participated in a road trip along the western coast of the United States, meeting with various experts on the topic, exchanging views and questions with people holding differing views. Cryptozoology Prothero has frequently written about the topic of cryptozoology, a pseudoscience and subculture, which he categorizes along with Holocaust denial and UFO abductions claims as aspects of American culture that are \"clearly baloney\".Prothero's 2013 book with Daniel Loxton, Abominable Science: The Origin of Yeti, Nessie, and Other Cryptids discusses the subculture in depth. In a review by Adrienne Mayor of Stanford University, she describes the book as \"An entertaining, educational, passionate, and valuable handbook for readers interested getting a scientific perspective on the field of cryptozoology. With marvelous artwork and deeply researched histories of the various creatures, this is an impressive and authoritative book.\" Anthropogenic global warming Prothero looks at the evidence regarding global warming and the role humans have had on it. In his book Greenhouse of the Dinosaurs, Prothero states \"geologists and paleoclimatologists know a lot about past greenhouse worlds, and the icehouse planet that has existed for the past 33 million years. We have a good understanding of how and why the Antarctic ice sheet first appeared at that time, and how the Arctic froze over about 3.5 million years ago, beginning the 24 glacial and interglacial episodes of the 'Ice Ages' that have occurred since then.\" In his article in eSkeptic, Prothero details carbon dioxide increases, melting polar icecaps, melting glaciers and sea level rise as some of the more important areas that point to anthropogenic global warming. He also goes into details to outline climate change deniers' arguments and rebuttals to those arguments and finally talks about why people deny climate change. Skepticism Prothero grew up in a Presbyterian household, but eventually became an atheist. He became involved in the skeptical movement in the mid-1990s, when Michael Shermer invited him to join the editorial board of The Skeptics Society. His first appearance as a panelist at The Amazing Meeting was in 2010.As a result of Prothero's books about evolution in 2007 and climate change in 2009, he recognized that \"those same people who were denying evolution are often the exact same people who deny climate [change].\" This realization led him to research and author \"Reality Check: How Science Deniers Threaten Our Future\" in 2013 as he explained during an interview on the podcast Skepticality: There are lots of people out there who accept science when it's convenient, but there's a lot of things that science tells us they don't want to hear and so then they reject those so-called inconvenient truths. And so this sort of weird, little way of doing things is not only true of creationists, it's true of climate deniers, it's true of AIDS deniers, anti-vaxxers, a whole bunch of various kinds of alternative medicines\u2014it's a very common thread. And many of them have very similar strategies in the way they battle against the reality of science... this is a scary thing because they will accept what science has done in the way of \"give us progress\" and \"give us technology\" and \"give us transportation\", and yet they just don't want science when it gets in the way of ideology or religion.

He has also been a member of Society for the Study of Mammalian Evolution since 2005. Critical reception Prothero's 2005 work The Evolution of North American Rhinoceroses received critical attention in the Journal of Paleontology, where Professor David Froehlich lauded the book's comprehensive coverage of North American rhinoceros species, but noted that the work would be less likely to appeal to nonspecialists, for whom the \"bulk of the book\" is likely to be \"more than most would like to know about North American rhinos.\" However, Froehlich wrote that for those \"who need this kind of detail, this book is virtually unmatched and indispensable,\" noting that his \"one real quibble\" was the \"lack of an overall discussion of rhinoceros evolution\" that was geographically comprehensive, which Froehlich thought would \"put these organisms in a global context for the nonspecialist.\"A May 2009 Reports of the National Center for Science Education review of Prothero's Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters described Prothero as \"equal to his task\" of providing resources for evaluating the fossil record, and praised the book's breadth of coverage of its topic. Although the reviewer criticized Prothero's treatment of creationist claims for the book's \"polemical tone\" and \"contempt\" for religion-based opponents of the biological sciences, he also noted that Prothero \"is well versed in the history of science and religion and makes it clear that he sees no necessary conflict between science and religion.\"In a review of Prothero's 2011 book Catastrophes!: Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Tornadoes, and Other Earth-Shattering Disasters for the American Library Association, Prothero is described as \"seiz[ing] teaching opportunities\" to explain the methods involved with taking metrics of the types of disasters discussed. While the reviewer praised Prothero for his approach to these topics and \"recommended\" the work, Prothero's \"presentation becomes more complex\" as the book discusses ice ages and global warming according to the reviewer, who states that \"with all scientists convinced that warming is occurring as a result of human action, [...] he disparages the denialists.\" Awards and honors Prothero has received a number of honors for his research as well as his lectures and books. In 1991, he received the Charles Schuchert Award of the Paleontological Society for the outstanding paleontologist under the age of 40. His book Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters received the 2007 PSP award for excellence in earth science from the Association of American Publishers.In 2013 he received the Diamond Award for Distinguished Achievement in Science and Technology from the Glendale Unified School District. The National Association of Geoscience Teachers selected him for the 2013 James Shea Award. His lectures on topics like evolution, fossil mammals and climate change have been featured at the Skeptic Society Lecture Series and at The Amaz!ng Meeting as well as the Paleontological Society where he was named a Distinguished Speaker in 1993\u20131994.Prothero was awarded the 2015 Joseph T Gregory Service Award honoring his outstanding service to the welfare of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. In 2016 he was awarded the Friend of Darwin award from the National Center for Science Education, with NCSE's executive director Ann Reid saying \"it would be hard to think of anyone who has contributed as much to the public understanding of the paleontological evidence for evolution and against creationism as Don Prothero.\" He was also named a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry citing his \"distinguished contributions to science and skepticism.\"The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) awarded Tim Callahan and Prothero the Robert P. Balles Annual Prize in Critical Thinking for their book UFOs, Chemtrails, and Aliens. CSI stated this book \"not only refute(s) false claims and misguided beliefs ... but more importantly they also arm readers with the tools they will need to fairly evaluate any extraordinary claim they come across\". The $2,500 prize will be awarded at the CSICon conference in Las Vegas, October 2018.

He is also a research associate with the Institute of International Integration Studies at Trinity College Dublin and a visiting researcher at the University of Oxford. He served as the 2016 president of the American Finance Association.  Career He earned his undergraduate degree in economics and political science from Trinity College at the University of Toronto in 1981 and his MBA from York University in Toronto in 1983. His doctoral work was carried out at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. His doctoral supervisors were Eugene Fama, Merton Miller, Robert Stambaugh, Wayne Ferson, Shmuel Kandel, and Lars Hansen. His 1986 Ph.D. thesis explored the concept that the term structure of interest rates (difference between long-term interest rates and short-term rates) could predict the US business cycle. His thesis was published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 1988. That work was subsequently expanded and published in the Financial Analysts Journal in 1989. Time-varying risk and risk premia Harvey's 1986 thesis showed that information in the term structure of interest rates was linked to future growth of the economy. When short-term rates were higher than long-term rates (an inverted yield curve), recessions followed. In the time since his thesis was published, the yield curve has inverted three times\u2014in 1989, 2000, and 2006\u2014correctly predicting the three recessions of 1990\u20131991, 2001, and 2007\u20132009.Given the idea that the business cycle is to some degree predictable, Harvey argued in his 1991 paper with Wayne Ferson in the Journal of Political Economy that both risk exposures and risk premia should vary predictably through the business cycle. Harvey's research in both the 1989 Journal of Financial Economics and in the 1991 Journal of Finance documented the predictability of asset returns. Emerging markets finance Harvey was one of the early finance researchers to study emerging markets' equity and bond returns. His 1995 paper in the Review of Financial Studies showed that the standard approaches in finance in developed markets could not be applied to many developing countries. His 1995 Journal of Finance paper with Geert Bekaert proposed a way of dealing with the special challenges of emerging markets. In multiple research papers authored with Bekaert, Harvey studies the relationship between the real economy and finance. His 2005 paper with Bekaert and Christian Lundblad shows opening financial markets to foreign investors reduces the cost of financing while increasing investment and GDP for developing countries. Survey work in finance Harvey is the founding director of the Duke University\/CFO Magazine Global Business Outlook Survey. In work with John Graham, he linked the theory and practice of finance. That is, many research papers make assumptions about how managers behave. Harvey's research asks the managers directly about these assumptions. The survey has been conducted every quarter since 1996 and has generated numerous research papers, including a paper published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2001. His paper with John Graham and Shiva Rajgopal in the Journal of Accounting and Economics in 2005 shows that 78% of Chief Financial Officers admit to destroying value by trying to hit quarterly earnings targets. Risk management Harvey has been a strong proponent of modifying the view of risk. Much risk modeling focuses on volatility or standard deviation. In his 2000 paper in the Journal of Finance with Siddique, Harvey presents a two-part argument in favor of incorporating skewness. First, asset returns are not normally distributed. Second, investors like positive skew (big profits) and dislike negative skew (big losses); Harvey argues these preferences need to be taken into account in both portfolio management and risk management. Harvey also asserts estimates are imprecise and this uncertainty needs to be taken into account when making investment decisions. Luck versus skill In a paper in the Review of Financial Studies in 2016, written with Yan Liu and Heqing Zhu, Harvey shows that over half of the published asset pricing factors are likely false. In a paper published in the Review of Financial Studies in 2018 with Yan Liu, Harvey shows how to improve the ability to detect skilled and unskilled managers with a method designed to reduce the noise in past performance. Harvey's Presidential Address to the American Finance Association, published in the Journal of Finance in 2017, challenges the way that research is conducted in empirical finance and points out some basic misunderstandings of statistics. Finally, Harvey's latest work with Yan Liu provides a new way to calibrate Type I (mistakenly choosing a bad manager) and Type II (missing a good investment manager) errors.

Early life Somdev was born into a Tripuri Hindu family in Guwahati, Assam to Ranjana and Pravanjan Dev Varman, a retired income tax commissioner. He belongs to the Indian state of Tripura. His family moved to Calcutta when he was 3 to 4 months old and stayed there until he was 8. His father's work took the family to Madras (Chennai) where Somdev grew up, beginning tennis at age 9, and studied at Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School. Devvarman started competing in Futures tournaments in 2002 at the age of 17. His biggest achievement during this time was a victory in the Kolkata F2 championship in 2004, after which he rose to 666 in the world rankings. He moved to the USA later that year and competed less regularly while at the University of Virginia. Somdev, while at college, won the 2007 NCAA Singles Championship by defeating Georgia Bulldog's senior, the top seed John Isner in the final. A year later, he defeated Tennessee's J.P. Smith to win his second consecutive NCAA Singles National Championship. Devvarman becomes the 13th player in the 124-year history of the tournament to win consecutive titles, and just the fourth to do so in the past 50 years with an unprecedented 44\u20131 record in 2008. Somdev finished university with a degree in sociology and turned pro in the summer of 2008. He won his first career title that year at a Futures tournament in Rochester, New York. The University of Virginia retired Devvarman's jersey in 2009. At the end of 2010, he was felicitated by the Tamil Nadu Tennis Association in Chennai. Professional results Early career After graduating from the University of Virginia, Devvarman signed with Mamba International, a sports management company based in Charlottesville, and started his professional career at the Futures tournament in Rochester, New York, where he won the singles title. He and his former university partner, Treat Huey, won the doubles title. The next week at another Futures match in Pittsburgh, Devvarman and Huey won the doubles title, and Devvarman the singles. Devvarman made the final of the Kennedy Funding Invitational in New York in July 2007. In a clay-court non-tour event which included several players ranked in the top 150, Devvarman defeated Ricardo Mello, Robert Kendrick, and Justin Gimelstob, before losing a three-set match to No. 69 Michael Russell in the final. He returned and won the tournament in 2008, beating Sam Querrey and Dudi Sela along the way. On 27 July 2008, Devvarman won the Lexington Challenger, first coming through qualifying, and then beating players including Bobby Reynolds, Xavier Malisse, and Robert Kendrick to take the title. He received automatic entry into the Vancouver Open and reached the quarterfinals, before his first professional defeat, by Go Soeda. In August 2008, Devvarman made the quarterfinals of the Legg Mason Tennis Classic, first beating Sam Warburg, Jamie Baker, and Soeda to qualify, and then beating Taylor Dent and Robert Kendrick in the main draw, before losing to Russian Igor Kunitsyn. At the BCR Bucharest Open, Devvarman lost to world No. 18 Nicol\u00e1s Almagro after winning the first set in the first round, having beaten No. 93 Italian Filippo Volandri in the final round of qualifying.

He had started the year at No. 1033. 2009: First ATP final Devvarman reached his first ATP Tour final at the 2009 Chennai Open, the first tournament of the new season, beating two-time Chennai Open champion and world No. 42 Carlos Moy\u00e1 of Spain and No. 25 Ivo Karlovi\u0107 of Croatia. Rainer Sch\u00fcttler of Germany pulled out due to injury in the semifinals, meaning that Devvarman progressed to the final. In the final, he lost to Marin \u010cili\u0107 of Croatia. At the year's first Grand Slam, the Australian Open, Somdev was seeded 28th in singles qualifying. He beat Prakash Amritraj in his first qualifying round; then lost to unseeded \u0141ukasz Kubot of Poland in the second round. After some poor results in qualifying and Challenger tournaments, Somdev had a successful Davis Cup campaign, winning both his matches against Chinese Taipei, including a critical reverse singles match against world No. 59 Yen-Hsun Lu to lead India to victory. In the second Grand Slam of 2009, the French Open, Devvarman was seeded 26th in singles qualifying. He defeated Jo\u00e3o Souza of Brazil in the first round and ousted Brit Alex Bogdanovic before losing to third seed and world No. 96 Marcos Daniel.

In doubles, Devvarman and partner Kevin Anderson advanced to the main draw, but lost to the fourth-seeded pair Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles. Devvarman had poor clay- and grass-court seasons, but was more successful upon return to hard courts, reaching the semifinals of the Comerica Bank Challenger. He then caused a major upset in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic, avenging his defeat in the Chennai Open against Marin \u010cili\u0107.

The day before, he had teamed up with Sanam Singh to win the gold in the doubles event. However, because tennis at both the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games are not ATP tour events, Somdev did not gain any ATP ranking points. Somdev rose to a career high ranking of No. 94 on 25 October. 2011: Breakthrough Somdev started 2011 ranked at No. 108. He started the season with the Chennai Open, an ATP 250 tournament, and lost to qualifier David Goffin in the first round.

In 2008, she signed a deal with Vivid Entertainment and Tristan Taormino to direct her own line of movies under the studio's sex education imprint, Vivid-Ed; the first film was \"Penny Flame's Expert Guide to Handjobs\", and the second was \"Penny Flame's Expert Guide to Rough Sex\".

Ketcham has said that she originally intended to disrupt the process in order to gain publicity and increase marketability as a porn star, but that after the first five days of treatment, she began to have a change of heart. Afterward, she entered a sober living facility, as depicted in the second season of Sober House, which premiered in March 2010.The last adult film that Ketcham performed in, titled Celebrity Pornhab with Dr. Screw (a parody of the Celebrity Rehab series that had recently featured porn star Mary Carey), was shot just before her participation in Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew.Ketcham discussed her path into pornography and her recovery from addiction with Pinsky and others in a March 17, 2010, appearance on The View. Ketcham stated on The View that she remained in the industry because it allowed her to work only three days a week while earning a substantial income; that it gave her the instant attention and acceptance of adoring fans, and it was the most convenient way to feed the sexual addiction associated with an inability to trust or form deep emotional connections with others; and that sex addiction preceded the substance addiction, but the two became intertwined and difficult to untangle. She explained that she had taken a year-long vow of abstinence when she completed treatment. Nine months into this period of abstinence, a friendship with a man who supported her recovery and attended \"12-step\" meetings with her became a committed, monogamous relationship.

Without the modification, Duncan Aviation would have transferred more than one hundred jobs from Battle Creek to its sister facility in Nebraska.

Segal advocated for full funding of the program throughout the budget process, but applauded the efforts of the bi-partisan School Aid conference committee for providing partial funding, $642,300, in its compromise budget. In an effort to save the MYCA, Segal launched an online petition, hosted a rally at the Capitol, and lobbied her fellow legislators for support. On November 25, 2009, the Michigan Youth ChalleNGe Academy announced that it would remain operational through at least 2010.

Early life Rizzo, a third-generation scout, grew up in Chicago as one of four children to Phil and Bernadine Rizzo. His father, Phil, was a former minor league baseball player who drove a truck for the city and scouted for the California Angels on a part-time basis. The Angels eventually made Phil a full-time scout, as many of the players he identified reached the majors. After 50 years in professional baseball, Phil was eventually part of the inaugural induction class that entered the Professional Baseball Scouts Hall of Fame in 2008. Phil continued his scouting career with the Nationals as a Senior Advisor to the GM until his passing on February 1, 2020. Mike Rizzo's grandfather, Vito, was a semi-pro player before founding the family business: scouting. Rizzo attended Holy Cross High School in River Grove, Illinois, Triton College, and Saint Xavier University, where he played college baseball for the Triton Trojans and Saint Xavier Cougars. Early career The Angels drafted Rizzo in the 22nd round, with the 554th overall selection, in the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft. He played for the Salem Angels (Class A Short Season), Peoria Suns (Class A) and Redwood Pioneers (Class A Advanced) from 1982 to 1984. After the 1984 season, the Angels released Rizzo. His father suggested that he was not skilled enough to reach the major leagues, and advised he attend college.Rizzo became an assistant coach at the University of Illinois while earning a Bachelor of Arts in Communications in 1988. Larry Himes, the scout who drafted Rizzo, became the general manager of the Chicago White Sox, and he hired Rizzo as a scout for the Upper Midwest region. While with the White Sox, Rizzo signed 2014 Hall of Fame inductee and two-time American League MVP Frank Thomas. He also scouted for the Boston Red Sox. Rizzo joined the Arizona Diamondbacks when the franchise was created in 1998, and served as the Director of Scouting for the Diamondbacks from 2000 to 2006. He helped transform the Diamondbacks farm system with exceptionally successful drafts. Following the 2005 campaign, Rizzo was promoted to Vice President of Scouting Operations. That same year, the Diamondbacks were named Topps\u2019 Organization of the Year. Rizzo earned a World Series ring with Arizona in 2001, and the organization brought an astounding number of homegrown players through to the Major Leagues during his tenure. Brandon Webb (2006 Cy Young Award winner), Carlos Gonzalez, Chad Tracy, Justin Upton, Stephen Drew, Dan Uggla, Micah Owings, Tony Pena, Mark Reynolds, Conor Jackson, Miguel Montero, Chris Snyder, Carlos Quentin, Max Scherzer and Brett Anderson were all signed by Arizona under Rizzo\u2019s watch. Washington Nationals Seeking to replace Joe Garagiola Jr. as the Diamondbacks' general manager, the team chose Josh Byrnes over Rizzo. As a result, Rizzo joined the Washington Nationals organization, when he was appointed Assistant General Manager and Vice President of Baseball Operations by Jim Bowden on July 24, 2006. This move coincided with the franchise's ownership transfer from Major League Baseball to a Washington, D.C.-based investment group headed by Ted Lerner.Three days after Bowden's sudden resignation on March 1, 2009, Rizzo was promoted to general manager on an interim basis by team president Stan Kasten. He was named the full-time Senior Vice President\/General Manager on August 20, 2009. On October 19, 2010, Rizzo signed a five-year contract extension and was promoted to Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations and General Manager. The last two years of this contract were club options.On June 24, 2021 at Miami, the Nationals beat the Marlins, 7-3, marking Rizzo\u2019s 1,000th win as General Manager since taking over the club during 2009 Spring Training. In doing so, he became the ninth active President of Baseball Operations\/General Manager to reach the 1,000 win mark and the sixth active to do it with one team. Since 2012, the Nationals have the fifth-best regular season record in Major League Baseball over this span, behind only the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals and Cleveland Guardians. The Nationals have transformed into one of Major League Baseball\u2019s perennially elite clubs, winning a World Series in 2019, earning four National League East titles (2012, 2014, 2016, 2017) and one Wild Card berth (2019) in the last nine seasons. For his efforts in leading the Nationals, Rizzo has been honored with several awards during his tenure. In April 2022, he was inducted into the Triton College Alumni Wall of Fame. In December 2021, he was named the Italian American Baseball Foundation Executive of the Year. After winning the World Series in 2019, he was named Executive of the Year by Baseball America and the Boston Chapter of the BBWAA. The Boston Chapter of the BBWAA also honored him with the same award following the 2012 season. He also garnered Executive of the Year honors in 2012 from the Pitch and Hit Club of Chicago, which followed 2011 Man of the Year honors from the Lido Civic Club of Washington, D.C. Over the course of Rizzo\u2019s tenure with the Nationals, there have been several seminal moments. In November of 2009, Rizzo convinced Davey Johnson to sign on as Senior Advisor and help revamp the Nationals\u2019 on-field operations. In June of 2011, Rizzo appointed him field manager and Johnson led the team to its first playoff appearance and through the 2013 season. On December 5, 2010, Rizzo signed right fielder Jayson Werth to a seven-year contract that immediately changed the perception of the Nationals, especially within the industry. Approximately one year later, Rizzo was instrumental in signing franchise cornerstone, Ryan Zimmerman, to a six-year contract extension. From 2009-12 Rizzo\u2019s Nationals won at least 10 more games than the season prior: 59 wins in 2009, 69 in \u201910, 80 in \u201911, 98 in \u201912. The last team to do this was the Boston Red Sox from 1906-09, making the Nationals the first team in over 100 years to complete such a feat without the benefit of an artificially deflated win total associated with a work stoppage. Rizzo decided to shut down ace pitcher Stephen Strasburg late in the 2012 season as he recovered from Tommy John surgery from the year before. The Nationals promoted Rizzo to President of Baseball Operations during the 2013 season.Solidifying arguably the best rotation in the Major Leagues, Rizzo and the Lerner Family signed 2013 American League Cy Young Award winner, right-handed pitcher Max Scherzer to a seven-year contract and introduced him to D.C. on January 21, 2015. In Dec. of 2015, Rizzo pulled off a three-team trade that yielded shortstop Trea Turner and right-handed pitcher Joe Ross from the San Diego Padres and sent outfielder Steven Souza Jr. to the Tampa Bay Rays. With the 2016 Baseball Winter Meetings taking place at nearby National Harbor, Md., Rizzo acquired outfielder Adam Eaton from the White Sox in exchange for top prospects Lucas Giolito, Reynaldo Lopez and Dane Dunning. In 2016, the team picked up its option to extend Rizzo's contract through the 2018 season.With Washington ahead in the division by nearly 10.0 games following the 2017 All-Star break, Rizzo saw the opportunity to get a jump on the trade market as the non-waiver trade deadline was nearly two weeks away. On July 16 in Cincinnati, with the club trying to complete the four-game sweep of the Reds that afternoon, Rizzo fortified Washington\u2019s bullpen by acquiring relievers Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson from the Oakland Athletics. From July 17 through the end of the season, the Nationals paced the National League with a 3.36 bullpen ERA. Rizzo was not finished improving the club in 2017, as he made two more deals as the deadline neared. On July 28, he solidified Washington\u2019s bench by acquiring veteran Howie Kendrick from the Philadelphia Phillies. Moments before the July 31 deadline, Rizzo strengthened Washington\u2019s bullpen even further with the acquisition of Minnesota Twins closer and American League All-Star, Brandon Kintzler. On April 5, 2018, Rizzo signed a contract extension through the 2020 season. When Kendrick went down with an Achilles injury on May 19, 2018, Rizzo made the call to bring the 19-year-old Juan Soto to the Major Leagues. From that day Soto put together one of the best seasons by a teenager in Major League history. After 11 seasons as the head of Washington\u2019s baseball operations \u2013 Rizzo guided the Washington Nationals to the 2019 World Series title, defeating the Houston Astros in seven games and securing the franchise's first championship on October 30, 2019. Rizzo's contract was then extended through 2023, giving him a raise above his $4 million per year salary.In a span of approximately 26 hours from July 29-30, 2021, Rizzo and the Washington Nationals acquired 12 players via six trades around the trade deadline. Those 12 players included Josiah Gray, Keibert Ruiz, Riley Adams, Mason Thompson, Gerardo Carrillo and Donovan Casey, among others. Other notable contributors Rizzo has brought in via trade during his tenure include Nelson Cruz, Josh Bell, Gio Gonzalez, Tanner Roark, Blake Treinen, Mark Melancon, Wilson Ramos, Denard Span, Kurt Suzuki, Michael Morse, and Sean Burnett, among others. Personal life Rizzo lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife, Jodi. His son, Michael Jr. is an entrepreneur living in San Diego, Calif.

Chase was awarded the 2003 Best Villain award at the MTV Movie Awards for her performance, beating out Mike Myers, Colin Farrell, Willem Dafoe and Daniel Day-Lewis. In the sequel to The Ring, The Ring Two (2005), Chase was credited for her role as Samara Morgan because of the use of archive footage from the first Ring, but Kelly Stables performed all of the new archive footage.Chase's main other major film and TV credits between 2000 and 2005 were the film Donnie Darko (2001), as Donnie's younger sister, Samantha, and Oliver Beene (2003\u20132004), as Oliver's quirky girlfriend Joyce. Other credits include The Rats (2002), Carolina (2003), R.L. Stine's Haunted Lighthouse (2003) in which she played a flying ghost called Annabel, and Beethoven's 5th (2003). She also made guest appearances in Touched by an Angel, Charmed, ER, Family Law, and The Practice. In 2006, Chase was given the role of Rhonda Volmer in the HBO drama series Big Love which centers on a polygamist family and its patriarch, Bill Henrickson, played by Bill Paxton. The show focuses upon Henrickson's relationship with his three wives. Chase's character is the child bride of a prophet, Roman Grant, played by Harry Dean Stanton. Leroy & Stitch, the finale to Lilo & Stitch: The Series, was released in 2006. Chase then appeared in the second season of Big Love, which aired in 2007. She also voiced Betsy in the PBS show Betsy's Kindergarten Adventures the same year. She reprised her role as Donnie Darko's younger sister, Samantha, in the film S. Darko. The story picks up seven years after the first film when Samantha Darko and her best friend Corey are now 18 years old and on a road trip to Los Angeles when they are afflicted by bizarre visions. In 2015, she starred in the thriller film Killer Crush and in the independent horror film Wild in Blue with Karen Black. In 2016, she starred in the thriller film American Romance with Nolan Gerard Funk, and appeared in the thriller film Jack Goes Home with Rory Culkin, Britt Robertson, Lin Shaye and Nikki Reed. Personal life Chase was arrested in November 2017 for riding in a stolen car. She was arrested again in 2018 for drug possession charges 18 months after allegedly leaving a dying man outside an emergency room.

In 2005, Time magazine named Ubik (1969) one of the hundred greatest English-language novels published since 1923. In 2007, Dick became the first science fiction writer ever to be included in The Library of America series.  Early life Dick and his twin sister, Jane Charlotte Dick, were born six weeks prematurely on December 16, 1928, in Chicago, Illinois, to Dorothy (n\u00e9e Kindred; 1900\u20131978) and Joseph Edgar Dick (1899\u20131985), who worked for the United States Department of Agriculture. His paternal grandparents were Irish. Jane's death on January 26, 1929, six weeks after their birth, profoundly affected Philip's life, leading to the recurrent motif of the \"phantom twin\" in his books.Dick's family later moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. When he was five, his father was transferred to Reno, Nevada, and when Dorothy refused to move, she and Joseph divorced. Both fought for custody of Philip, which was awarded to Dorothy. Determined to raise Philip alone, she took a job in Washington, D.C. and moved there with her son. Philip was enrolled at John Eaton Elementary School (1936\u20131938), completing the second through fourth grades. His lowest grade was a \"C\" in Written Composition, although a teacher said he \"shows interest and ability in story telling\". He was educated in Quaker schools. In June 1938, Dorothy and Philip returned to California, and it was around this time that he became interested in science fiction. Dick stated that he read his first science fiction magazine, Stirring Science Stories, in 1940.Dick attended Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California. He and fellow science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin were members of the class of 1947 but did not know each other at the time. He claimed to have hosted a classical music program on KSMO Radio in 1947. From 1948 to 1952, he worked at Art Music Company, a record store on Telegraph Avenue. He attended the University of California, Berkeley from September 1949 to November 11, 1949, ultimately receiving an honorable dismissal dated January 1, 1950. He did not declare a major and took classes in history, psychology, philosophy, and zoology. Dick dropped out because of ongoing anxiety problems, according to his third wife Anne's memoir. She also says he disliked the mandatory ROTC training. At Berkeley, he befriended poet Robert Duncan and poet and linguist Jack Spicer, who gave Dick ideas for a Martian language. Through his studies in philosophy, he believed that existence is based on internal human perception, which does not necessarily correspond to external reality. He described himself as \"an acosmic panentheist,\" believing in the universe only as an extension of God. After reading the works of Plato and pondering the possibilities of metaphysical realms, he came to the conclusion that, in a certain sense, the world is not entirely real and there is no way to confirm whether it is truly there. This question from his early studies persisted as a theme in many of his novels. Career Early writing Dick sold his first story, \"Roog\", in 1951, when he was 22, about \"a dog who imagined that the garbagemen who came every Friday morning were stealing valuable food which the family had carefully stored away in a safe metal container\". From then on he wrote full-time. During 1952, his first speculative fiction publications appeared in July and September numbers of Planet Stories, edited by Jack O'Sullivan, and in If and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction that year. His debut novel, Solar Lottery, was published in 1955 as half of Ace Double #D-103 alongside The Big Jump by Leigh Brackett. The 1950s were a difficult and impoverished time for Dick, who once lamented, \"We couldn't even pay the late fees on a library book.\" He published almost exclusively within the science fiction genre but dreamed of a career in mainstream fiction. During the 1950s, he produced a series of non-genre, relatively conventional novels.In 1960, Dick wrote that he was willing to \"take twenty to thirty years to succeed as a literary writer\". The dream of mainstream success formally died in January 1963 when the Scott Meredith Literary Agency returned all of his unsold mainstream novels. Only one of them, Confessions of a Crap Artist, was published during Dick's lifetime, in 1975 by Paul Williams' Entwhistle Books. In 1963 Dick won the Hugo Award for The Man in the High Castle. Although he was hailed as a genius in the science fiction world, the mainstream literary world was unappreciative, and he could publish books only through low-paying science fiction publishers such as Ace. Even in his later years, he continued to have financial troubles. In the introduction to the 1980 short story collection The Golden Man, he wrote: \"Several years ago, when I was ill, Heinlein offered his help, anything he could do, and we had never met; he would phone me to cheer me up and see how I was doing. He wanted to buy me an electric typewriter, God bless him\u2014one of the few true gentlemen in this world. I don't agree with any ideas he puts forth in his writing, but that is neither here nor there. One time when I owed the IRS a lot of money and couldn't raise it, Heinlein loaned the money to me. I think a great deal of him and his wife; I dedicated a book to them in appreciation. Robert Heinlein is a fine-looking man, very impressive and very military in stance; you can tell he has a military background, even to the haircut. He knows I'm a flipped-out freak and still he helped me and my wife when we were in trouble. That is the best in humanity, there; that is who and what I love.\" Flight to Canada, mental health and suicide attempt In 1971, Dick's marriage to Nancy Hackett broke down, and she moved out of their house in Santa Venetia, California. He had abused amphetamine for much of the previous decade, stemming in part from his need to maintain a prolific writing regimen due to the financial exigencies of the science fiction field. He allowed other drug users to move into the house. Following the release of 21 novels between 1960 and 1970, these developments were exacerbated by unprecedented periods of writer's block, with Dick ultimately failing to publish new fiction until 1974.One day, in November 1971, Dick returned to his home to discover it had been burglarized, with his safe blown open and personal papers missing. The police couldn't determine the culprit, and even suspected Dick of having done it himself. Shortly thereafter, he was invited to be guest of honor at the Vancouver Science Fiction Convention in February 1972. Within a day of arriving at the conference and giving his speech, The Android and the Human, he informed people that he had fallen in love with a woman named Janis whom he had met there and announced that he would be remaining in Vancouver. A conference attendee, Michael Walsh, movie critic for the local newspaper The Province, invited Dick to stay in his home, but asked him to leave two weeks later due to his erratic behavior. Janis then ended their relationship and moved away. On March 23, 1972, Dick attempted suicide by taking an overdose of the sedative potassium bromide. Subsequently, after deciding to seek help, Dick became a participant in X-Kalay (a Canadian Synanon-type recovery program), and was well enough by April to return to California. In October 1972, Dick wrote a letter to the FBI about science fiction writer Thomas Disch.On relocating to Orange County, California at the behest of California State University, Fullerton professor Willis McNelly (who initiated a correspondence with Dick during his X-Kalay stint), he donated manuscripts, papers and other materials to the university's Special Collections Library, where they are in the Philip K. Dick Science Fiction Collection in the Pollak Library. During this period, Dick befriended a circle of Fullerton State students that included several aspiring science fiction writers, including K. W. Jeter, James Blaylock and Tim Powers. Jeter would later continue Dick's Bladerunner series with three sequels.Dick returned to the events of these months while writing his novel A Scanner Darkly (1977), which contains fictionalized depictions of the burglary of his home, his time using amphetamines and living with addicts, and his experiences of X-Kalay (portrayed in the novel as \"New-Path\"). A factual account of his recovery program participation was portrayed in his posthumously released book The Dark Haired Girl, a collection of letters and journals from the period. Paranormal experiences On February 20, 1974, while recovering from the effects of sodium pentothal administered for the extraction of an impacted wisdom tooth, Dick received a home delivery of Darvon from a young woman. When he opened the door, he was struck by the dark-haired girl's beauty, and was especially drawn to her golden necklace. He asked her about its curious fish-shaped design. As she was leaving, she replied: \"This is a sign used by the early Christians.\" Dick called the symbol the \"vesicle pisces\". This name seems to have been based on his conflation of two related symbols, the Christian ichthys symbol (two intersecting arcs delineating a fish in profile), which the woman was wearing, and the vesica piscis.Dick recounted that as the sun glinted off the gold pendant, the reflection caused the generation of a \"pink beam\" of light that mesmerized him. He came to believe the beam imparted wisdom and clairvoyance, and also believed it to be intelligent. On one occasion, he was startled by a separate recurrence of the pink beam, which imparted the information that his infant son was ill. The Dicks rushed the child to the hospital, where the illness was confirmed by professional diagnosis. After the woman's departure, Dick began experiencing strange hallucinations. Although initially attributing them to side effects from medication, he considered this explanation implausible after weeks of continued hallucination. He told Charles Platt: \"I experienced an invasion of my mind by a transcendentally rational mind, as if I had been insane all my life and suddenly I had become sane.\" Throughout February and March 1974, Dick experienced a series of hallucinations which he referred to as \"2-3-74\", shorthand for February\u2013March 1974. Aside from the \"pink beam\", he described the initial hallucinations as geometric patterns, and, occasionally, brief pictures of Jesus and ancient Rome. As the hallucinations increased in duration and frequency, Dick claimed he began to live two parallel lives\u2014one as himself, \"Philip K. Dick\", and one as \"Thomas\", a Christian persecuted by Romans in the first century AD. He referred to the \"transcendentally rational mind\" as \"Zebra\", \"God\" and \"VALIS\" (an acronym for Vast Active Living Intelligence System). He wrote about the experiences, first in the semi-autobiographical novel Radio Free Albemuth, then in VALIS, The Divine Invasion, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer and the unfinished The Owl in Daylight (the VALIS trilogy).In 1974, Dick wrote a letter to the FBI, accusing various people, including University of California, San Diego professor Fredric Jameson, of being foreign agents of Warsaw Pact powers. He also wrote that Stanis\u0142aw Lem was probably a false name used by a composite committee operating on orders of the Communist party to gain control over public opinion.At one point, Dick felt he had been taken over by the spirit of the prophet Elijah. He believed that an episode in his novel Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said was a detailed retelling of a biblical story from the Book of Acts, which he had never read. He documented and discussed his experiences and faith in a private journal he called his \"exegesis\", portions of which were later published as The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick. The last novel he wrote was The Transmigration of Timothy Archer; it was published shortly after his death in 1982. Personal life Dick was married five times: Jeanette Marlin (May to November 1948) Kleo Apostolides (June 14, 1950, to 1959) Anne Williams Rubinstein (April 1, 1959, to October 1965) Nancy Hackett (July 6, 1966, to 1972) Leslie \"Tessa\" Busby (April 18, 1973, to 1977)Dick had three children, Laura Archer Dick (born February 25, 1960, to Dick and his third wife, Anne Williams Rubenstein), Isolde Freya Dick (now Isa Dick Hackett) (born March 15, 1967, to Dick and his fourth wife, Nancy Hackett), and Christopher Kenneth Dick (born July 25, 1973, to Dick and his fifth wife, Leslie \"Tessa\" Busby).In 1955, Dick and his second wife, Kleo Apostolides, received a visit from the FBI, which they believed to be the result of Kleo's socialist views and left-wing activities.Dick's third wife, Anne Williams Rubinstein, often fought with him. Dick wrote to a friend that he and Anne had \"dreadful violent fights...slamming each other around, smashing every object in the house.\" In 1963, Dick told his neighbors that his wife was attempting to kill him, and had her involuntarily committed to a psychiatric institution for two weeks. After filing for divorce in 1964, Dick moved to Oakland to live with a fan, author and editor Grania Davis. Shortly after, he attempted suicide by driving off the road while she was a passenger. Politics Dick tried to stay out of the political scene because of high societal turmoil from the Vietnam War. Still, he did show some anti-Vietnam War and anti-governmental sentiments. In 1968, he joined the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\", an anti-war pledge to pay no U.S. federal income tax, which resulted in the confiscation of his car by the IRS.Dick's 1968 novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, condemns the eugenics movement. In 1974, as a response to the Roe v. Wade decision, Dick published The Pre-persons, an anti-abortion and anti-Malthusianism short story. Following the story's publication, Dick stated that he received death threats from feminists. Death On February 17, 1982, after completing an interview, Dick contacted his therapist, complaining of failing eyesight, and was advised to go to a hospital immediately, but did not. The following day, he was found unconscious on the floor of his Santa Ana, California home, having suffered a stroke. On February 25, 1982, Dick suffered another stroke in the hospital, which led to brain death. Five days later, on March 2, 1982, he was disconnected from life support. After his death, Dick's father, Joseph, took his son's ashes to Riverside Cemetery in Fort Morgan, Colorado, (section K, block 1, lot 56), where they were buried next to his twin sister Jane, who died in infancy. Her tombstone had been inscribed with both of their names at the time of her death, 53 years earlier. Philip died four months before the release of Blade Runner, the film based on his novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Style and works Themes Dick's stories typically focus on the fragile nature of what is real and the construction of personal identity. His stories often become surreal fantasies, as the main characters slowly discover that their everyday world is actually an illusion assembled by powerful external entities, such as the suspended animation in Ubik, vast political conspiracies or the vicissitudes of an unreliable narrator. \"All of his work starts with the basic assumption that there cannot be one, single, objective reality\", writes science fiction author Charles Platt. \"Everything is a matter of perception. The ground is liable to shift under your feet. A protagonist may find himself living out another person's dream, or he may enter a drug-induced state that actually makes better sense than the real world, or he may cross into a different universe completely.\"Alternate universes and simulacra are common plot devices, with fictional worlds inhabited by common, working people, rather than galactic elites. \"There are no heroes in Dick's books\", Ursula K. Le Guin wrote, \"but there are heroics. One is reminded of Dickens: what counts is the honesty, constancy, kindness and patience of ordinary people.\" Dick made no secret that much of his thinking and work was heavily influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. The Jungian constructs and models that most concerned Dick seem to be the archetypes of the collective unconscious, group projection\/hallucination, synchronicities, and personality theory. Many of Dick's protagonists overtly analyze reality and their perceptions in Jungian terms (see Lies, Inc.).Dick identified one major theme of his work as the question, \"What constitutes the authentic human being?\" In works such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, beings can appear totally human in every respect while lacking soul or compassion, while completely alien beings such as Glimmung in Galactic Pot-Healer may be more humane and complex than their human peers. Understood correctly, said Dick, the term \"human being\u201d applies \u201cnot to origin or to any ontology but to a way of being in the world.\" This authentic way of being manifests itself in compassion that recognizes the oneness of all life. \"In Dick\u2019s vision, the moral imperative calls on us to care for all sentient beings, human or nonhuman, natural or artificial, regardless of their place in the order of things. And Dick makes clear that this imperative is grounded in empathy, not reason, whatever subsequent role reason may play.\" The figure of the android depicts those who are deficient in empathy, who are alienated from others and are becoming more mechanical (emotionless) in their behaviour. \"In general, then, it can be said that for Dick robots represent machines that are becoming more like humans, while androids represent humans that are becoming more like machines.\" Mental illness was a constant interest of Dick's, and themes of mental illness permeate his work. The character Jack Bohlen in the 1964 novel Martian Time-Slip is an \"ex-schizophrenic\". The novel Clans of the Alphane Moon centers on an entire society made up of descendants of lunatic asylum inmates. In 1965, he wrote the essay titled \"Schizophrenia and the Book of Changes\".Drug use (including religious, recreational, and abuse) was also a theme in many of Dick's works, such as A Scanner Darkly and The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch. Dick himself was a drug user for much of his life. According to a 1975 interview in Rolling Stone, Dick wrote all of his books published before 1970 while on amphetamines. \"A Scanner Darkly (1977) was the first complete novel I had written without speed\", said Dick in the interview. He also experimented briefly with psychedelics, but wrote The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch (1965), which Rolling Stone dubs \"the classic LSD novel of all time\", before he had ever tried them. Despite his heavy amphetamine use, however, Dick later said that doctors told him the amphetamines never actually affected him, that his liver had processed them before they reached his brain.Summing up all these themes in Understanding Philip K. Dick, Eric Carl Link discussed eight themes or 'ideas and motifs': Epistemology and the Nature of Reality, Know Thyself, The Android and the Human, Entropy and Pot Healing, The Theodicy Problem, Warfare and Power Politics, The Evolved Human, and 'Technology, Media, Drugs and Madness'. Pen names Dick had two professional stories published under the pen names Richard Phillipps and Jack Dowland. \"Some Kinds of Life\" was published in October 1953 in Fantastic Universe under byline Richard Phillipps, apparently because the magazine had a policy against publishing multiple stories by the same author in the same issue; \"Planet for Transients\" was published in the same issue under his own name.The short story \"Orpheus with Clay Feet\" was published under the pen name Jack Dowland. The protagonist desires to be the muse for fictional author Jack Dowland, considered the greatest science fiction author of the 20th century. In the story, Dowland publishes a short story titled \"Orpheus with Clay Feet\" under the pen name Philip K. Dick.The surname Dowland refers to Renaissance composer John Dowland, who is featured in several works. The title Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said directly refers to Dowland's best-known composition, \"Flow, my tears\". In the novel The Divine Invasion, the character Linda Fox, created specifically with Linda Ronstadt in mind, is an intergalactically famous singer whose entire body of work consists of recordings of John Dowland compositions. Selected works The Man in the High Castle (1962) is set in an alternate history in which the United States is ruled by the victorious Axis powers. It is the only Dick novel to win a Hugo Award. In 2015 this was adapted into a television series by Amazon Studios.The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch (1965) utilizes an array of science fiction concepts and features several layers of reality and unreality. It is also one of Dick's first works to explore religious themes. The novel takes place in the 21st century, when, under UN authority, mankind has colonized the Solar System's every habitable planet and moon. Life is physically daunting and psychologically monotonous for most colonists, so the UN must draft people to go to the colonies. Most entertain themselves using \"Perky Pat\" dolls and accessories manufactured by Earth-based \"P.P. Layouts\". The company also secretly creates \"Can-D\", an illegal but widely available hallucinogenic drug allowing the user to \"translate\" into Perky Pat (if the drug user is a woman) or Pat's boyfriend, Walt (if the drug user is a man). This recreational use of Can-D allows colonists to experience a few minutes of an idealized life on Earth by participating in a collective hallucination.Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) is the story of a bounty hunter policing the local android population. It occurs on a dying, poisoned Earth de-populated of almost all animals and all \"successful\" humans; the only remaining inhabitants of the planet are people with no prospects off-world. The 1968 novel is the literary source of the film Blade Runner (1982). It is both a conflation and an intensification of the pivotally Dickian question: \"What is real, what is fake? What crucial factor defines humanity as distinctly 'alive', versus those merely alive only in their outward appearance?\"Ubik (1969) employs extensive psychic telepathy and a suspended state after death in creating a state of eroding reality. A group of psychics is sent to investigate a rival organisation, but several of them are apparently killed by a saboteur's bomb. Much of the following novel flicks between different equally plausible realities and the \"real\" reality, a state of half-life and psychically manipulated realities. In 2005, Time magazine listed it among the \"All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels\" published since 1923.Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said (1974) concerns Jason Taverner, a television star living in a dystopian near-future police state. After being attacked by an angry ex-girlfriend, Taverner awakens in a dingy Los Angeles hotel room. He still has his money in his wallet, but his identification cards are missing. This is no minor inconvenience, as security checkpoints (staffed by \"pols\" and \"nats\", the police and National Guard) are set up throughout the city to stop and arrest anyone without valid ID. Jason at first thinks that he was robbed, but soon discovers that his entire identity has been erased. There is no record of him in any official database, and even his closest associates do not recognize or remember him. For the first time in many years, Jason has no fame or reputation to rely on. He has only his innate charm and social graces to help him as he tries to find out what happened to his past while avoiding the attention of the pols. The novel was Dick's first published novel after years of silence, during which time his critical reputation had grown, and this novel was awarded the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. It is the only Philip K. Dick novel nominated for both a Hugo and a Nebula Award.In an essay written two years before his death, Dick described how he learned from his Episcopal priest that an important scene in Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said \u2013 involving its other main character, the eponymous Police General Felix Buckman, was very similar to a scene in Acts of the Apostles, a book of the New Testament. Film director Richard Linklater discusses this novel in his film Waking Life, which begins with a scene reminiscent of another Dick novel, Time Out of Joint.A Scanner Darkly (1977) is a bleak mixture of science fiction and police procedural novels; in its story, an undercover narcotics police detective begins to lose touch with reality after falling victim to Substance D, the same permanently mind-altering drug he was enlisted to help fight. Substance D is instantly addictive, beginning with a pleasant euphoria which is quickly replaced with increasing confusion, hallucinations and eventually total psychosis. In this novel, as with all Dick novels, there is an underlying thread of paranoia and dissociation with multiple realities perceived simultaneously. It was adapted to film by Richard Linklater.The Philip K. Dick Reader is an introduction to the variety of Dick's short fiction. VALIS (1980) is perhaps Dick's most postmodern and autobiographical novel, examining his own unexplained experiences. It may also be his most academically studied work, and was adapted as an opera by Tod Machover. Later works like the VALIS trilogy were heavily autobiographical, many with \"two-three-seventy-four\" (2-3-74) references and influences. The word VALIS is the acronym for Vast Active Living Intelligence System. Later, Dick theorized that VALIS was both a \"reality generator\" and a means of extraterrestrial communication. A fourth VALIS manuscript, Radio Free Albemuth, although composed in 1976, was posthumously published in 1985. This work is described by the publisher (Arbor House) as \"an introduction and key to his magnificent VALIS trilogy\".Regardless of the feeling that he was somehow experiencing a divine communication, Dick was never fully able to rationalize the events. For the rest of his life, he struggled to comprehend what was occurring, questioning his own sanity and perception of reality. He transcribed what thoughts he could into an eight-thousand-page, one-million-word journal dubbed the Exegesis. From 1974 until his death in 1982, Dick spent many nights writing in this journal. A recurring theme in Exegesis is Dick's hypothesis that history had been stopped in the first century AD, and that \"the Empire never ended\". He saw Rome as the pinnacle of materialism and despotism, which, after forcing the Gnostics underground, had kept the population of Earth enslaved to worldly possessions. Dick believed that VALIS had communicated with him, and anonymously others, to induce the impeachment of U.S. President Richard Nixon, whom Dick believed to be the current Emperor of Rome incarnate.In a 1968 essay titled \"Self Portrait\", collected in the 1995 book The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick, Dick reflects on his work and lists which books he feels \"might escape World War Three\": Eye in the Sky, The Man in the High Castle, Martian Time-Slip, Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb, The Zap Gun, The Penultimate Truth, The Simulacra, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch (which he refers to as \"the most vital of them all\"), Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, and Ubik. In a 1976 interview, Dick cited A Scanner Darkly as his best work, feeling that he \"had finally written a true masterpiece, after 25 years of writing\". Adaptations Films Several of Dick's stories have been made into films. Dick himself wrote a screenplay for an intended film adaptation of Ubik in 1974, but the film was never made. Many film adaptations have not used Dick's original titles. When asked why this was, Dick's ex-wife Tessa said, \"Actually, the books rarely carry Phil's original titles, as the editors usually wrote new titles after reading his manuscripts. Phil often commented that he couldn't write good titles. If he could, he would have been an advertising writer instead of a novelist.\" Films based on Dick's writing had accumulated a total revenue of over US$1 billion by 2009. Blade Runner (1982), based on Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford, Sean Young and Rutger Hauer. A screenplay had been in the works for years before Scott took the helm, with Dick being extremely critical of all versions. Dick was still apprehensive about how his story would be adapted for the film when the project was finally put into motion. Among other things, he refused to do a novelization of the film. But contrary to his initial reactions, when he was given an opportunity to see some of the special effects sequences of Los Angeles 2019, Dick was amazed that the environment was \"exactly as how I'd imagined it!\", though Ridley Scott has mentioned he had never even read the source material. Following the screening, Dick and Scott had a frank but cordial discussion of Blade Runner's themes and characters, and although they had wildly differing views, Dick fully backed the film from then on, stating that his \"life and creative work are justified and completed by Blade Runner\". Dick died from a stroke less than four months before the release of the film.

Influence and legacy Lawrence Sutin's 1989 biography of Dick, Divine Invasions: A Life of Philip K. Dick, is considered the standard biographical treatment of Dick's life. In 1993, French writer Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re published Je suis vivant et vous \u00eates morts which was first translated and published in English in 2004 as I Am Alive and You Are Dead: A Journey Into the Mind of Philip K. Dick, which the author describes in his preface in this way:The book you hold in your hands is a very peculiar book. I have tried to depict the life of Philip K. Dick from the inside, in other words, with the same freedom and empathy \u2013 indeed with the same truth \u2013 with which he depicted his own characters. Critics of the book by Carr\u00e8re have complained about the lack of fact checking, sourcing, notes and index, \"the usual evidence of deep research that gives a biography the solid stamp of authority.\" It can be considered a non-fiction novel about his life.Dick has influenced many writers, including Jonathan Lethem and Ursula K. Le Guin. The prominent literary critic Fredric Jameson proclaimed Dick the \"Shakespeare of Science Fiction\", and praised his work as \"one of the most powerful expressions of the society of spectacle and pseudo-event\". The author Roberto Bola\u00f1o also praised Dick, describing him as \"Thoreau plus the death of the American dream\". Dick has also influenced filmmakers, his work being compared to films such as the Wachowskis' The Matrix, David Cronenberg's Videodrome, eXistenZ, and Spider, Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Alex Proyas's Dark City, Peter Weir's The Truman Show, Andrew Niccol's Gattaca, In Time, Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys, Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar's Open Your Eyes, David Fincher's Fight Club, Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky, Darren Aronofsky's Pi, Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko and Southland Tales, Rian Johnson's Looper, Duncan Jones' Source Code, Christopher Nolan's Memento and Inception, and Owen Dennis' Infinity TrainThe Philip K. Dick Society was an organization dedicated to promoting the literary works of Dick and was led by Dick's longtime friend and music journalist Paul Williams. Williams also served as Dick's literary executor for several years after Dick's death and wrote one of the first biographies of Dick, entitled Only Apparently Real: The World of Philip K. Dick.The Philip K. Dick estate owns and operates the production company Electric Shepherd Productions, which has produced the film The Adjustment Bureau (2011), the TV series The Man in the High Castle and also a Marvel Comics 5-issue adaptation of Electric Ant.Dick was recreated by his fans in the form of a simulacrum or remote-controlled android designed in his likeness. Such simulacra had been themes of many of Dick's works. The Philip K. Dick simulacrum was included on a discussion panel in a San Diego Comic Con presentation about the film adaptation of the novel, A Scanner Darkly. In February 2006, an America West Airlines employee misplaced the android's head, and it has not yet been found. In January 2011, it was announced that Hanson Robotics had built a replacement.

Theater The short play Kindred Blood in Kensington Gore (1992) by Brian W. Aldiss A 2005 play, 800 Words: the Transmigration of Philip K. Dick by Victoria Stewart, which re-imagines Dick's final days. Contemporary philosophy Postmodernists such as Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson, Laurence Rickels and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek have commented on Dick's writing's foreshadowing of postmodernity. Jean Baudrillard offers this interpretation: \"It is hyperreal. It is a universe of simulation, which is something altogether different. And this is so not because Dick speaks specifically of simulacra. SF has always done so, but it has always played upon the double, on artificial replication or imaginary duplication, whereas here the double has disappeared. There is no more double; one is always already in the other world, an other world which is not another, without mirrors or projection or utopias as means for reflection. The simulation is impassable, unsurpassable, checkmated, without exteriority. We can no longer move 'through the mirror' to the other side, as we could during the golden age of transcendence.\" For his anti-government skepticism, Philip K. Dick was afforded minor mention in Mythmakers and Lawbreakers, a collection of interviews about fiction by anarchist authors. Noting his early authorship of The Last of the Masters, an anarchist-themed novelette, author Margaret Killjoy expressed that while Dick never fully sided with anarchism, his opposition to government centralization and organized religion has influenced anarchist interpretations of gnosticism. Video games The 3.0 update for the grand strategy video game Stellaris is named the \"Dick\" update, following the game's trend of naming updates after science fiction authors.

In 623, while Du (by that point known as Li Fuwei after being bestowed the imperial surname) was at the Tang capital Chang'an, Fu rose against Tang rule at Danyang (\u4e39\u694a, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu) and declared himself emperor of a new state of Song.  In 624, he was defeated by the Tang general Li Xiaogong.  He fled, but was captured and delivered to Li Xiaogong, who executed him.  Initial uprising Fu Gongshi was from Qi Province (\u9f4a\u5dde, roughly modern Jinan, Shandong). He often stole sheep from his uncle to give to his best friend Du Fuwei, who was younger than he was, causing both of them to come to the attention of the police. They fled, and they became agrarian rebels against Sui dynasty rule, in or briefly before 613. Du eventually became a major rebel leader, and Fu served as his lieutenant. In 613, it was Fu who, at Du's direction, persuaded another rebel leader, Miao Haichao (\u82d7\u6d77\u6f6e), to submit to Du's leadership, and he also contributed to Du's subsequent surprise attack and killing of another rebel leader, Zhao Pochen (\u8d99\u7834\u9673). Submission to Tang After the death of Emperor Yang of Sui in 618, Du Fuwei initially contended for supremacy of the lower Yangtze River region with fellow rebel leader Li Zitong the Emperor of Wu and the former Sui officials Shen Faxing the Prince of Liang and Chen Leng (\u9673\u7a1c), but after he was defeated by Li in 619, he submitted to the Tang dynasty. Emperor Gaozu of Tang (Li Yuan) commissioned Du as the commandant of the region, and in summer 620, Emperor Gaozu created Du the Prince of Wu, bestowed on him the imperial surname of Li, and made him the head of the branch imperial government for the region, while creating Fu Gongshi the Duke of Shu and making him Du's deputy. Later that year, Li Fuwei commissioned Fu to lead an army against Li Zitong, with Li Fuwei's officers (whom he had formally adopted as sons) Wang Xiongdan (\u738b\u96c4\u8a95) and Kan Leng (\u95de\u7a1c) as Fu's assistants. Fu was quickly able to capture Danyang, and he had initial further battle successes against Li Zitong. However, after a Li Zitong counterattack, Fu stopped engaging Li Zitong. Wang, against Fu's orders, counterattacked himself and defeated Li Zitong, forcing him to flee and take over Shen's territory, while Li Zitong's former territory came under Li Fuwei's control. Rebellion against Tang Meanwhile, friction had been developing between Li Fuwei and Fu Gongshi. It had been that for years, the army, knowing the great friendship between Li Fuwei and Fu, honored Li Fuwei as its father and Fu as its \"uncle.\" Eventually, however, Li Fuwei became suspicious of the respect the army had for Fu, and began to give more authorities to Wang Xiongdan and Kan Leng, giving them effective command of the army. When Fu realized that Li Fuwei was suspecting him, he became resentful, but pretended to lose interest in the army, instead studying alchemy with his friend Zuo Youxian (\u5de6\u904a\u4ed9). In 622, Li Fuwei, fearful that Emperor Gaozu might doubt his loyalty, went to the Tang capital Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Gaozu, taking Kan with him. Before he departed, he left Fu in command, with Wang as Fu's deputy, in actual command of the forces, secretly warning Wang, \"If I suffer no ill consequences, make sure that Fu does nothing rash.\" When Li Fuwei got to Chang'an, Emperor Gaozu gave him the special treatment of allowing him to sit with Emperor Gaozu on the imperial seat and, at other occasions, honor even above Emperor Gaozu's son Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi. However, he did not permit Li Fuwei or Kan to return to Danyang, making Kan a general. Once Li Fuwei left Danyang, Zuo persuaded Fu into planning a rebellion. However, Wang had actual command of the army, and therefore, Fu decided to trick Wang by claiming that Li Fuwei was doubting Wang's loyalty. Wang, angry over the revelation, gave up command of the army, and Fu took control and then tried to persuade Wang to join his plot. Wang, realizing that he had been tricked, nevertheless refused to join Fu, so Fu strangled him. In fall 623, Fu, claiming that Li Fuwei had been detained by Emperor Gaozu and had ordered him to rebel, did so. He soon declared himself the Emperor of Song, and he was able to get another rebel leader who had submitted to Tang as well, Zhang Shan'an (\u5f35\u5584\u5b89), who controlled the modern northern Jiangxi and eastern Hubei region, to submit to him. Emperor Gaozu sent his generals Li Xiaogong the Prince of Zhao Commandery (the son of his cousin), Li Jing, Huang Junhan (\u9ec3\u541b\u6f22), and Li Shiji against Fu, with Li Xiaogong in overall command. In winter 623, Zhang was captured by the Tang general Li Daliang, cutting off a flank support for Fu. Defeat and death For several months, Tang and Song forces battled on the border, but as the main forces under Li Xiaogong and Li Jing approached, Fu had his generals Feng Huiliang (\u99ae\u6167\u4eae) and Chen Dangshi (\u9673\u7576\u4e16) take up defense positions at Mount Bowang (\u535a\u671b\u5c71, in modern Ma'anshan, Anhui), preparing for the assault. Fu's orders to Feng and Chen were to refuse engagement and to wear the Tang forces out, but Li Xiaogong cut off their food supplies, and so they abandoned the strategy and challenged Li Xiaogong. Most of Li Xiaogong's subordinates believed that Feng and Chen had a strong army and could not be easily defeated, and so that Li Xiaogong should bypass them and attack Danyang directly. However, Li Jing opposed, pointing out that if Tang forces did not defeat Feng and Chen first, they would not be able to siege the well-fortified Danyang easily. Li Xiaogong agreed and engaged Feng and Chen directly, defeating them, as the Song forces lost morale when they saw that Kan was fighting on the Tang side. Feng and Chen fled back to Danyang. Li Xiaogong and Li Jing trailed them and approached Danyang. Fu, in fear, abandoned Danyang and fled east, heading toward Kuaiji (modern Shaoxing), a fortified city on Hangzhou Bay then defended by Zuo. On the way, however, his army began to desert, and he only had 500 men left when he reached Chang Prefecture (\u5e38\u5dde, roughly modern Changzhou, Jiangsu). There, his subordinate Wu Sao (\u5433\u9a37) considered seizing him and surrendering. When Fu discovered this, he fled with less than 100 guards; when he reached Wukang (\u6b66\u5eb7, in modern Huzhou, Zhejiang), he was attacked by the men of the country. After his confidant, Ximen Junyi (\u897f\u9580\u541b\u5100), was killed in the battle, he was captured. He was delivered to Danyang, where Li Xiaogong executed him.

Early life and career Fritz Peters' parents were Frederick Peters (Premier of Prince Edward Island, 1891\u20131897) and Roberta Hamilton Susan Gray (daughter of John Hamilton Gray, who was Premier of Prince Edward Island at the time of the Charlottetown Conference of 1864). He was educated at St. Peter's School on Prince Edward Island, at school in British Columbia and at Naval College in England. Two of Peters' brothers died in action on the Western Front during the First World War\u2014John Francklyn Peters in April 1915 and Gerald Hamilton Peters in June 1916. Peters entered the Royal Navy as midshipman in 1905 and began the First World War as a lieutenant. He retired in 1919 at the age of thirty as a commander, having won the Distinguished Service Order and the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) during the war. Peters then split his time between Britain, Canada and the Gold Coast. Second World War In October 1939 Peters re-volunteered for Royal Navy service. He was made the commander of an anti-submarine flotilla. In 1940 he was awarded a Bar to his DSC and was later appointed acting captain for special services.Peters was 53 years old, and a captain in the Royal Navy during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC: Operation Reservist (part of Operation Torch, the Allied landings in French North Africa) was an attempt to capture Oran Harbour, Algeria and prevent it from being sabotaged by its French garrison. The two sloops HMS Walney and HMS Hartland were packed with British Commandos, soldiers of the 6th United States Armored Infantry Regiment and a small detachment of United States Marines. On 8 November 1942 Captain Peters, commanding in Walney, led his force through the boom towards the jetty in the face of point-blank fire from shore batteries, the sloop La Surprise, and the destroyer Epervier. Blinded in one eye, he alone of 11 officers and men on the bridge survived. Besides him, 13 ratings survived Walney sinking. The destroyer reached the jetty disabled and ablaze and went down with her colours flying. Captain Peters and a handful of men managed to reach the shore, where they were taken prisoner. Hartland came under fire from the French destroyer Typhon and blew up with the loss of half her crew. The survivors, like those of Walney, were taken prisoner as they reached shore.Captain Peters was also awarded the United States Army's Distinguished Service Cross for the same actions. The citation, issued in Allied Force Headquarters General Orders No. 19 23 November 1942, stated that: Captain Peters distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism against an armed enemy during the attack on that post. He remained on the bridge in command of his ship in spite of the fact that the protective armor thereon had been blown away by enemy shell fire and was thereby exposed personally to the withering cross fire from shore defenses. He accomplished the berthing of his ship, then went to the forward deck and assisted by one officer secured the forward mooring lines. He then with utter disregard of his own personal safety went to the quarter-deck and assisted in securing the aft mooring lines so that the troops on board could disembark. At that time the engine room was in flames and very shortly thereafter exploded and the ship turned on its side and sank. The survivors were released on 10 November 1942 when the French garrison surrendered. In the meantime, the French systematically destroyed the harbour facilities at Oran: Operation Reservist was thus a complete failure. In addition to his service with the Royal Navy, Fritz worked with British Naval Intelligence and advised Prime Minister Winston Churchill. British double agent Kim Philby noted his admiration for Secret Intelligence Service instruction leader \"Commander Peters\" in his book My Silent War. Death Captain Peters was killed in an air crash three days after his release, on 13 November 1942. He was coming back to Britain in a Sunderland flying boat, which crash-landed in Plymouth Sound in thick fog, at the entrance to the Royal Navy's Devonport Dockyard, near Plymouth, Devon. In spite of efforts by the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Wynton Thorpe, RAAF, who held on to him for ninety minutes in the water, he was dead when the rescue launch reached them. He has no known grave and is remembered on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial, (Panel 61. Column 3) Hampshire, England. Mount Peters near Nelson, British Columbia, where his mother lived in her last years with the family of her daughter Helen Dewdney and her husband E.E.L. Dewdney, was named in his honour in 1946. A display of photos and panels on his life is on the main floor of the Daniel J. MacDonald Building in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. His name, along with the names of his three brothers who served in the First World War, is on memorial plaques in the St. Peter's Anglican Church in Charlottetown.

He played college football at Colgate University and an end. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982.  Early years Orsi was born on November 11, 1908, in Newark, New Jersey to Italian immigrant parents. The youngest of seven children, he grew up in Newark and attended Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey. In 1926, the Columbia High football team, with Orsi, made it to the state finals but lost 7\u20130. Orsi moved on to The Perkiomen School from 1927 to 1928. On his birthday in 1967, he was honored at Perkiomen with 'John Orsi Day' to mark his athletic exploits. He also served as the chairman of the Annual Gift Fund at Perkiomen for that school year. Colgate Orsi moved on to Colgate University, where he was a three-sport star. He played basketball and ran track, but starred in football for the head coach Andrew Kerr. With Orsi at end, Colgate went 25\u20133 from 1929 to 1931. He made headlines in 1930 in a postseason charity game against NYU at Yankee Stadium. With Colgate leading 7\u20130, NYU scored a late touchdown to bring the score to 7\u20136, but Orsi blocked the ensuing extra point attempt to seal the victory. Lloyd Jordan, an assistant coach with Colgate at the time, later recalled that block as one of the best memories of his coaching career. The block in 1930 set the stage for Orsi's All-American year in 1931. Colgate had a great year with Orsi as a senior captain, only losing to NYU in Yankee Stadium. Orsi had perhaps his best game against rival Syracuse at Archbold Stadium. Colgate won the game 21\u20137 with Orsi scoring one touchdown and paving the way with blocks on the other two. After the season, Orsi was selected to the All-America team and was invited to Hollywood for the filming of 'The All-American' (1932). Coaching Orsi did not go far after graduating as he joined Kerr's coaching staff at Colgate. He was the end coach beginning in 1932 with the famous undefeated, untied, unscored upon, and uninvited team. He held the position as end coach until resigning in 1941. He moved on to the William Penn Charter School as an assistant coach in 1942 and assumed the head coaching position for the 1943 season. From 1944 to 1945, he was an assistant coach at Germantown Academy and from 1946 to 1956 he was the head coach at Episcopal Academy. He later became vice president of the Maxwell Football Club and was on hand at their award ceremonies, including 1968 when O. J. Simpson won the Maxwell Award. Personal life Orsi married Elizabeth Claire Shea in 1936 and they had three children. Elizabeth died from leukemia, and Orsi remarried to Katherine White in 1953. Orsi lived in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania for much of his later life and died in 1978, in Naples, Florida.

He made his national team debut for Serbia in 2005. He was in the squad for his nation in one major tournament - FIFA World Cup 2006. He has made a total of 18 caps for Serbia.  Club career Early years The first football step Basta made was when he was eight \u2013 in local football club PKB from Padinska Skela, the suburb where he lived and where he was born. He then signed for Red Star aged thirteen, becoming a part of one of the most talented generations in the history of Red Star's youth academy. Red Star Belgrade Basta signed his first professional contract at the age of 17, when he together with a few teammates from Red Star's youth team broke out into the senior squad. He made his professional debut on his 18th birthday (18 August 2002) in a 1\u20130 defeat from Sutjeska in Nik\u0161i\u0107, Montenegro. In the following, his second season, he played on loan in Jedinstvo Ub (along with Aleksandar Lukovi\u0107 and Bo\u0161ko Jankovi\u0107). Over the season Basta displayed great technique, skills, and pass accuracy and very soon he became one of the most important players for Red Star Belgrade. In April 2005 Basta suffered an injury which kept him out of football for five months. By the end of his spell at Red Star, Basta won six trophies with Red Star Belgrade, including three domestic doubles. Udinese In July 2008 he moved from Red Star Belgrade to Udinese. He played in pre-season friendlies for Udinese. However, Udinese did not wish to allocate one of the two non-EU registration quota on Basta, and Basta moved to Lecce on loan from Red Star Belgrade, in order to borrow the quota from Lecce, like his teammate and countryman Aleksandar Lukovi\u0107. After returning to Udinese in summer 2009, he became the starting right wingback soon after the season started instead of his usual midfield position. He made his debut on 23 September 2009 against A.C. Milan, replacing Mauricio Isla after 27 minutes. Udinese won the match 1\u20130. After injuries to Simone Pepe, he played as a right-sided midfielder in their 3\u20135\u20132 formation for a few matches. Basta was later injured and missed the whole 2010\u201311 Serie A season, meaning that Mauricio Isla secured Basta's place in the team. Basta made his return after 18 months on 11 September, the first gameweek of the 2011\u201312 Serie A season. In that match the coach Francesco Guidolin rested Isla, using Basta as the right wingback in their 3\u20135\u20132 formation. He scored a goal, beating Lecce 2\u20130. In the next match, the first group stage match of the 2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League, Basta returned to the bench. On 6 November 2011, Basta scored the first goal in a 2\u20131 victory against Siena. On 11 December 2011, the Serb headed in Udinese's second goal in a 2\u20131 victory against Chievo. He then scored a powerful shot against struggling Cesena. Lazio Basta signed with Lazio on 23 June 2014 in a temporary deal, with an obligation to buy. Eventually Basta cost Lazio \u20ac10.5 million.On 30 April 2017 Basta returned to score a goal in the Serie A, three years later the previous one (Udinese-Roma 2\u20133, 17 March 2014) and against the same opponent team: his goal allowed Lazio to win the Derby della Capitale against the city rivals of Roma (Lazio won the match 3\u20131 away and Basta scored the second goal). International career Basta debuted for his country against Spain on 31 March 2005. He substituted Ognjen Koroman in 77 minutes. He collected his second cap in Tunisia. He was in Serbia and Montenegro team for World Cup in Germany, but he did not play. For Serbia U21s selection he played 18 games and he played on two European Under-21 Football Championship, First time in Portugal 2006 he reached semi-final, second time he became losing finalists in the Netherlands 2007. He was called up by the caretaker of the Serbia national football team, Radovan \u0106ur\u010di\u0107, for two friendly matches, against Mexico and Honduras, as a replacement for the injured Neven Suboti\u0107. Shortly after being called up, he suffered an injury. \u0106ur\u010di\u0107 called up Nemanja Tomi\u0107, Adem Ljaji\u0107 and Andrija Kalu\u0111erovi\u0107 instead.

Reception Laurent Touil-Tartour has received overwhelmingly enthusiastic critical reception upon the release of Urban Wolf.

But even without dialogue, French filmmaker Laurent Touil-Tartour has made an unusually sophisticated spy-tech thriller.\u201dCritic Jandy Stone Hardesty, in her review for Row Three, said that Touil-Tartour has \u201ca nice flair for composition and a good sense of visual storytelling, he also knows how to do good twists and suggest things rather than spell them out, something I really appreciated.\u201d William Bibbiani, in CraveOnline, called it \"an exciting little bit of filmmaking that deserves its notoriety and is worth howling about\", and Liz Shannon Miller writing in GigaOM wrote that \"\u201cUrban Wolf is a gripping thriller that stands out as proudly unique. Some of Wolf's execution might emulate classic 1970s thrillers, but the concept is pure 21st century, playing nimbly with issues of privacy and paranoia. When a director can make even the eating of a potato chip seem malevolent (as occurs in the yet-to-premiere episode 7), you know you've watching something special.\"Reviewing it for the Mingle Media TV Network, journalist Kristyn Burtt wrote: \"The reason this series stands out amongst the pack is its cinematic feel and the utilization of mise en scene. You don't hear the main character utter a word until Episode 7, and boy, is it effective.\u201dAwarding the film a five out of five star rating, Feo Amante's film critic E.C.McMullen Jr. wrote: \"The tension from episode to episode is incredible and Laurent just keeps ramping it up.

History Britain's Got Talent In January 2009, the group auditioned for the third series of the ITV television show Britain's Got Talent. For their audition, they performed I'll Be There by Jackson 5. The audience gave the family a standing ovation but Simon had a few words of advice for the group. He said that whilst he loved the kids singing he was put off by Estelle's and particularly Giles' vocals. He advised them to take a smaller role in the act and let the children perform. The other judges agreed. They received three yes votes and were put through to the next round. They were chosen as one of the 40 semi-finalists. Reports at the time said that Evans' voice changed and wasn't able to hit the high notes. He was singing with his family at their home in Winsford Avenue, Allesley Park, when he noticed a change in his voice. He said \"It's been worrying \u2013 I was singing when I noticed I couldn't speak properly because my voice was really croaky.They performed for a second time in the semi-final on 29 May 2009.

Piers buzzed during the performance, saying afterwards: 'It just doesn't work. Elliot is the star here.' Amanda said: 'Piers is talking utter rot and as a family man I am disgusted with him. She added: 'The girls were unbelievably adorable and you did brilliantly'. Simon Cowell said 'Elliot I don't think it was the right song for your voice. You're not going to win but you've all had a nice night out.'. The crowd booed his comments, so he said something more positive. \"'The three kids probably have a future in showbusiness.

Antebellum Deane was born in Assonet, Massachusetts to John and Lydia (Andros) Deane. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Andros, was a veteran of the Revolution. He attended local schools in Assonet and Myricks, and later at the Foxboro English and Classical School. After completing his own schooling, Deane served as a schoolteacher at Berkley Common and at the South School of Assonet Village. The Rebellion Through the 1850s, increasing tension between the slave and free states gave a new purpose to the monthly, quarterly, and annual drills and exercises of the various state militias. Since the start of the republic, the bulk of any army during a war was initially expected to be supplied by trained recruits from local, organized militias fleshing out the professional regulars until raw recruits could be trained and equipped if needed. In the decades between the Mexican\u2013American War and the Civil War, the militias were funded and trained by the states. As common with militias at the time, Company Officers were elected to their rank. In Massachusetts, companies of militia were based in various towns and had individual, distinct unit identities as a source of civic pride. As an 18-year-old school teacher, Deane enlisted in Assonet's militia company, the Assonet Light Infantry, in September, 1858. The local companies, as in 1775 were organized as part of a regionally-based regiment. In southeastern Massachusetts, this meant that the Assonets were Company G of the 3rd Regiment, Massachusetts Militia. Annually, the companies would go into an encampment with the parent regiment for drill. He was appointed Sergeant and Company Clerk in August 1860 and elected as the third Lieutenant a month later. Service with the \"Minute men of '61\" The 3rd Massachusetts was organized for active service on April 15, 1861 in response to President Lincoln's call for 75,000 troops to put down the insurrection in the southern states. The Assonet Light Infantry, as Company G, received word to mobilize from its commander, Colonel David W. Wardrop of New Bedford, Massachusetts, during the night of April 15\u201316. As a member of one of the first Massachusetts regiments to report for service in Boston on April 16, Deane became a member of a group of militia men known as the \"Minutemen of '61,\" in reference to the Minutemen who turned out in April 1775 during the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant upon federal mobilization, Deane and Company G joined the regiment in Boston. The 3rd only had seven out of ten companies required by its table of organization so it added three newly recruited companies of three-year recruits to come up to strength (after the regiment's 90 day obligation expired, these three companies transferred to the 1st Battalion, Massachusetts Volunteers and later the 29th Massachusetts) before sailing from Boston. Arriving via ship at Fort Monroe in the morning of April 20, 1861, Deane crossed Hampton Roads on board the USS Pawnee to the Gosport Navy Yard. To prevent the expected fall of the yard, its vessels, and valuable stores into Confederate hands, G Companythe 3rd Massachusetts was tasked with setting fire to all buildings, vessels and stores. Although Wardrop felt the 3rd could successfully defend the yard, he was ordered to destroy it. Deane's company and the regiment returned aboard the Pawnee which towed the USS Cumberland to Fortress Monroe, saving the frigate from falling into enemy hands. In executing this assignment, the 3rd Massachusetts claimed that they were the first Union troops to make an incursion on territory held by the Confederacy.During May and June 1861, the 3rd Massachusetts garrisoned Fort Monroe and conducted occasional patrols beyond the fort. On July 1, the regiment was ordered to occupy Fort Calhoun and the town of Hampton, Virginia just four miles from the Monroe. For a few weeks, Deane commanded the men of Company G acting as the garrison of Fort Calhoun. Confederate forces were massing nearby at Big Bethel and the post was considered a dangerous one due to the proximity of the enemy and the secessionist sentiments of the local population. One soldier of the 3rd Massachusetts was shot and beaten while at Hampton, though he survived.On July 16, the regiment marched to Fortess Monroe and boarded a steamship for Boston. They were mustered out at Camp Wightman on Long Island in Boston harbor on July 22. Deane again took up teaching at South School. Service with 29th Massachusetts After teaching in Assonet for one school year, Deane was offered and accepted a commission as a 2nd Lieutenant with the 29th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment. This assignment was a bit of a reunion as seven of the companies had filled out the 3rd Massachusetts Militia during its service the year prior. Deane joined the regiment at White House Landing on the Pamunkey, a major Army of the Potomac supply base and rail head, just as the 29th Massachusetts was assigned to the Irish Brigade (2nd Brigade, 1st Division, II Corps). Contemporaries and historians alike have wondered at this unusual assignment. due to the significant social friction in New England between established Protestant families and Irish immigrants. 2LT Deane and the bulk of the 29th Massachusetts were descended, largely, from old-stock English families (like his mother's family), some with heritage dating back to the Mayflower. While the regimental historian observed that the 29th was heartily welcomed to the Irish Brigade, other historians point out the oddity of the \"aristocratic 29th Massachusetts ... thrown in with three regiments of New York Irishmen.\" Historian Daniel Callaghan quotes period sources describing the \"unlikely matching of ancient political foes,\" and the manner in which the men of the 29th tolerated the Irish-born commander of the Irish Brigade, Brig. Gen. Thomas Francis Meagher, \"coldly, in a pinched and critical silence.\" Deane and his fellow Yankees made it work as the 29th Massachusetts and the rest of the brigade fought well together, earning plaudits for hard campaigning during the Seven Days Battles; most notably at Savage's Station, Glendale, and Malvern Hill. After Malvern Hill, Deane, the 29th, and the rest of the brigade remained at Harrison's Landing while other units were transferred to northern Virginia during the summer of 1862 to fight under Gen. John Pope. After Pope was defeated during the Second Battle of Bull Run on August 30, 1862, the 29th Massachusetts joined the Army of the Potomac south of Washington.Emboldened by the 2nd Bull Run, Lee invaded Maryland in September 1862. Deane was with the 29th Massachusetts when the two armies met at Sharpsburg, Maryland and fought the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862. Deane was with the Irish Brigade in its assault on the \"Sunken Road\" or \"Bloody Lane.\" The 29th, despite advancing in good order under heavy fire and delivering effective fire in return, did not reach the Sunken Road. The brigade retired, the regimental historian observed, \"as steadily as on drill.\". The casualties of the 29th were nine killed, 31 wounded and four missing.After Antietam while in camp in Falmouth in late November, the officers of the 29th learned that Meagher had arranged for a green Irish Brigade flag to be presented to the regiment, recognizing their role as \"honorary Irishmen\" and their bravery during the Battle of Antietam. Barnes declined the gift because while \"proud to receive the flag for the regiment as a token of the respect of their Irish comrades ... it was not an Irish regiment.\" As a result, on 30 November, Deane and his comrades were transferred over to Brig. Gen. Benjamin C. Christ's brigade in the IX Corps. The originally intended regiment, the 28th Massachusetts, took its place.The transfer spared the 29th from the Battle of Fredericksburg in which their new brigade played almost no role. Their former comrades in the Irish Brigade, however, made a harrowing charge during the battle and suffered severe casualties. For his performance with the regiment, Deane was promoted to 1st Lieutenant in Falmouth, VA 29 December 1862.On 5 February 1863, the 29th as part of IX Corps, transferred to the Department of the Ohio and Union operations in Kentucky and east Tennessee. The 29th Massachusetts reached Cincinnati via railroad on March 26, then marched into Kentucky. Deane was appointed Acting Assistant Adjutant General at Paris, Kentucky on 1 April. He remained there through September while the regiment served in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi. In September 1863, Deane detached and reported to temporary duty at Draft Rendezvous, Boston Harbor where he helped organize, process, and escort recruits to the fronts. Of note, he escorted the 54th and 55th Massachusetts from Boston to Morris Island, South Carolina in January 1864.In May 1864, he returned to the 29th in time for the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. He was promoted to captain and company command 8 June 1864.In the pre-dawn hours of June 17, the divisions of the IX Corps formed up for an assault on the entrenched Confederate position outside Petersburg. While other divisions of the IX Corps attacked and were repulsed, the 29th in the 1st Division moved to its assigned position in the late afternoon and received the order to attack. The division, including the 29th, charged from their protected position in a ravine out into an open plain in front of the Confederate entrenchments. According to the regimental historian, \"They had scarcely emerged upon the open plain, when the whole crest of the Confederate works was fringed with fire and smoke; grape, canister, and musket balls filled the air.\". The 29th was forced to pause in its advance and retired a short distance. The 1st Division of the IX Corps eventually captured the Confederate works in their front, however little had been accomplished by the assault on Petersburg overall. The Confederates remained strongly entrenched and the long Siege of Petersburg began. The 29th, numbering just 100 men at this time, lost six killed and 23 wounded.Deane and the 29th fought on through the fall of 1864 into the spring of 1865. Throughout this period, Deane served as a company commander and regimental adjutant. Before dawn on March 25, Deane captured and disarmed a Captain of the 4th North Carolina. Despite this incident, Confederate troops achieved complete surprise just before dawn and easily overran Fort Stedman entering the rear sally port almost unchallenged. Major Charles T. Richardson, then in command of the 29th, hearing some light gunfire, ordered the 29th to fall in. No general alarm had yet been raised, but Richardson given Deane's capture of a prisoner, he felt certain that an attack was underway. Within minutes, approximately 500 Confederates, a small part of the overall offensive, swept over Battery 11. The 29th held their ground, however, engaging in heated hand-to-hand combat and eventually capturing 300 Confederates\u2014more than twice their own number. The Confederates still occupied Fort Stedman, however, and soon sent another offensive to occupy Battery 11. This time, the 29th was forced to retreat back to Fort Haskell, the nearest defensible position. In the retreat, Richardson was captured and Dean took command. At Fort Haskell he worked the guns on his pursuers to such an effect as to stop them. He only left the guns to successfully recapture Battery 11. After recapturing Battery 11, Dean captured another Confederate officer, a major in the 4th Georgia who was caught trying to make off with the personal belongings of one of Deane's brother officers.After four hours, the Confederate attack lost momentum, and their forces began to pull back into Fort Stedman. An overwhelming Union counterattack eventually recaptured the fort. The 29th took part in the counterattack, re-capturing Battery 11. Color-bearer Conrad Homan of the 29th was the first to re-enter Battery 11 and was later awarded the Medal of Honor. The regiment lost 10 killed and an unknown number of captured in this engagement. The 29th was crucial in the victory at the Battle of Fort Stedman on 25 March for which Deane won the Medal of Honor for his conduct. He was also breveted to Major as a result of his gallantry on 25 March.When the siege ended, the 29th was pulled back to The 29th did not take part in the pursuit of Lee's army during the Appomattox Campaign. The small regiment was instead withdrawn to Washington shortly after Lee's surrender and served as provost guards in the capital. On August 11, 1865, the 29th was mustered out of service. Deane's service took him to thirteen states, and he traveled thousands of miles. He fought the war as part of the II, V, and IX Corps. He was never sick nor wounded. Postbellum Life After discharge he returned to teaching at the South School in Assonet. At the end of the next school year, he left teaching and went into business as a partner in Hathaway & Deane in Fall River in general merchandise. On November 20, 1866, Deane married Mary Gray Pearce (1846\u20131923). She was the daughter of Abner Tompkins and Sarah Read (Briggs) Pearce. With Mary, he had three children: Milton Irving Deane \u2014 30 April 1868\u201311 February 1952 served in the US Navy during the Spanish-American War Richard Boynton Deane \u2014 12 July 1869 \u2013 23 November 1950 Charles Learned Deane \u2014 25 August 1871 \u2013 9 July 1955 Anna Louise Andros Deane \u2014 23 July 1877 \u2013 1 October 1957 Wallis Pearce Deane \u2014 2 May 1881 \u2013 7 August 1949in 1885, he became involved with the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), an early veterans' organization, when he joined the Richard Borden Post No. 46 In Fall River. He was very active in veterans' affairs and served the organization as the Post Commander, as various district\/departmental\/national offices, and as Commander of the Department of Massachusetts in 1897. His wife, Mary was alongside him helping establish the auxiliary of the GAR, the Woman's Relief Corps, at the Richard Borden Post. Like her husband, she was also very active in veterans affairs and relief. Deane was also a companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He was elected a resident member of the Old Colony Historical Society in 1902. In 1896\u201397, he had erected a home on Water Street in Assonet that is now the Assonet Inn. On September 2, 1914, John Deane died at the age of 74. He is buried in the Assonet Burying Ground. His wife Mary survived him until 11 February 1923 when she passed at age 76. In 1989, a ceremony was held in the Assonet Burying Ground during which a government marker was placed on Deane's grave. In 2005, Deane's diaries from the period 1861\u20131865 were published by the Freetown Historical Society as Civil War Diaries of Maj. John M. Deane, Medal of Honor Winner, 1861\u20131865. Medal of Honor citation In a letter dated March 8, 1895, Col. W. F. Ainsworth informed Deane that he had been awarded the Medal of Honor \"for most distinguished gallantry in action at Fort Steadman, Virginia, March 25, 1865, in serving with other volunteers, a previously silenced and abandoned gun, mounted en barbette, at Fort Haskell, being exposed to a galling fire from the enemy's sharpshooters.\" See also List of Medal of Honor recipients List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients: A\u2013F 3rd Massachusetts Volunteer Militia Regiment 29th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment Grand Army of the Republic Notes References External links John M.

Levine's Second World War epic A Bridge Too Far, which starred an international cast, including Dirk Bogarde, Sean Connery, Michael Caine and James Caan.In 1977, Cross became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company; he performed in the premiere of Privates on Parade as \"Kevin Cartwright\" and played Rover in a revival of a Restoration play titled Wild Oats. Cross's path to international stardom began in 1978 with his performance in the musical Chicago, in which he played Billy Flynn, the slick lawyer of murderess Roxie Hart. 1980s\u20131990s During Cross's performance in Chicago he was recognised and recommended for a leading role in the multiple Oscar-winning film Chariots of Fire in 1981. The film was based on the true story of two athletes in the 1924 Olympics: Eric Liddell, a devout Scottish Christian, and Harold Abrahams, an English Jew who runs to overcome prejudice. Cross trained hard for his role as Abrahams; his co-star Ian Charleson played Liddell. The pair were shown in the opening scene running barefoot with a group of others along a Scottish beach, accompanied by Vangelis's music. Considered \"one of the most memorable opening scenes in film history\", Cross acknowledged the scene's effectiveness but remembered the water was freezing. For their performances in the film, Cross and Charleson both won \"Most Promising Artiste of 1981\" awards from the Variety Club Awards in February 1982. Cross's starring role in Chariots of Fire has been credited with continuing a transatlantic trend in elegant young English actors that had been set by Jeremy Irons in Brideshead Revisited. The film went on to win multiple Academy Awards, including the one for Best Picture.Cross followed up Chariots of Fire with performances as a Scottish physician, Dr Andrew Manson, struggling with the politics of the British medical system during the 1920s, in The Citadel, a 10-part BBC Television dramatisation of A. J. Cronin's novel, and as Ashton (Ash) Pelham-Martyn, a British cavalry officer torn between two cultures in the ITV miniseries The Far Pavilions.In 1982, the U.S. union Actors' Equity, in a landmark reversal of a previous ruling, allowed Cross to appear in John Guare's off-Broadway play Lydie Breeze. The decision was tied to a joint effort by Actors' Equity, the League of New York Theatres and the British union Equity to allow British and U.S. actors unrestricted opportunities to work in both countries. The agreement eventually led to regular equal exchange agreements for equivalent acting jobs between London and New York City.During the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, Cross appeared in a commercial for American Express ('Don't leave home without it') with the 87-year-old Jackson Scholz, a sprinter for the 1924 American Olympic team whose character was featured in the film Chariots of Fire. When Cross talks about beating Scholz, the latter remarks, \"You didn't beat me!\" with mock indignation. Proving he is 'still pretty fast', Scholz beats Cross to the draw in picking up the tab with his credit card.He subsequently replaced James Garner as the featured actor endorsing the Polaroid Spectra camera in 1986. Cross was also featured in GQ Magazine as one of the annual \"Manstyle\" winners in January 1985 followed by a featured photo shoot in March 1985.In 1985, he played Barney Greenwald in a revival of Herman Wouk's courtroom drama The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial at the Queen's Theatre, London, alongside castmates Charlton Heston (as Captain Queeg) and John Schuck.In a 1985 interview, the actor admitted he preferred American roles because of their emotionalism, saying of English acting: \"Over here, people hide behind mannerism and technique and don't come up with any soul. American actors are much freer with the emotions. It's pretty hard in Europe not to have experience of Americans because we're exposed to a lot of American product.\" Cross also said that he was sympathetic to the American dream of success: \"I am ambitious. There's no point of being ashamed of the fact that one has ambitions. Despite what a lot of people think in our profession, you can have ambitions and still turn in good work and still earn a living. There's no clash there.\" Cross expressed the hope that his reputation would \"span the Atlantic,\" and that those in the industry would not ignore him because he did not live in Los Angeles or New York City. \"A prospective director would have to convince me that I could bring something new, fresh and exciting to a classical part that hundreds of other people have played,\" he said.During this time, Cross' career included several roles in made-for-television productions, as well as the stage. In the 1988 HBO spy film Steal the Sky he played Munir Redfa, an Iraqi pilot blackmailed into flying a MiG aircraft from Iraq to Israel. In Ian Sharp's 1989 NBC-TV miniseries Twist of Fate, he played German Nazi SS colonel and war criminal Helmut von Schraeder, who has his face and voice surgically changed to pose as a Jew in a concentration camp to avoid both Hitler's retaliation for his role in the failed 20 July plot against him and war's end capture and post-war war crimes trial and punishment by the approaching Allies, then after his liberation at the war's end by the title's name becomes a Zionist and one of Israel's early founders and leading military generals. He twice portrayed a vampire, first in the 1989 USA Network film Nightlife, then again as Barnabas Collins in the 1991 MGM miniseries remake of the cult classic TV soap opera Dark Shadows. Cross also appeared as Sir Harold Pearson in the 1994 Italian production Caro Dolce Amore (Honey Sweet Love), Solomon in the 1997 Trimark Pictures production Solomon and Captain Nemo in the 1997 CBS film 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. 2000\u20132020 Cross played Ikey Solomon in the Australian production The Potato Factory in 2000. In 2005, Cross, an anti-death penalty campaigner, starred as a death-row prisoner in Bruce Graham's play Coyote on a Fence, at the Duchess Theatre. He played Rudolf Hess in the 2006 BBC production Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial. In November 2007, Cross was cast in the role of Sarek in the 2009 Star Trek film directed and produced by J. J. Abrams. Cross spoke to Star Trek magazine following the film's release, saying: My agent put me forward for Star Trek, and he sent a couple of films to J.J. I'm sure he was too busy to watch the whole of Species, but when we were on the set, he mentioned to me that there was one particular shot in it where I turned to the camera, and in that moment, it came to him how perfect it would be for me to play Sarek. In order to prepare for the role, Cross drew on his experience as a parent as well as Sarek's previous on-screen appearances. Having been present when his daughter was born, he was able to \"call on all sorts of things\" in the scene where Amanda has baby Spock, a scene which did not make it into the theatrical cut of the film. While he found the emotionless trait of a Vulcan a challenge to play, he found the father\/son relationship between Sarek and Spock easier to play. According to Cross: As Sarek, I had to be true to the Vulcan cultural ethic, which in the beginning, I found very difficult. I got a lot of help with that from J.J. Dealing with the adult Spock (played by Zachary Quinto) was a much more mature relationship, and I found the father\/son aspect one of the easier things to play. In 2012, Cross was cast as Rabbit, the main antagonist on the Cinemax original series Banshee. Rabbit is \"a ruthless Ukrainian gangster who has been hunting down two of his former top thieves for 15 years.\" After 2012, Cross acted in various minor films but also acted in The Hurricane Heist, which earned a box office of US$32.5 million. In 2019, he starred with Whoopi Goldberg in the film Master of Dark Shadows, which earned a rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, his second film to receive such a rating, the other one being Paperhouse. Directing, screenwriting, and music Cross was also a director, writer, and musician. He wrote music, screenplays, and articles for English-language publications, and the lyrics for an album with Bulgarian singer Vasil Petrov, which was released in late 2007. He sang two Frank Sinatra songs with Petrov in the Apollonia Festival at the Black Sea in September 2007.Among his works was the musical Rage about Ruth Ellis, which was performed in the London area. He starred in it and played the part of the hangman.Cross's first single as a lyricist was released by Polydor Records in the late 1970s and was titled \"Mickey Moonshine\". The nom de guerre for the performance had occurred to Cross when he recalled an earlier involvement with the music industry as a session singer for Decca Records between 1972 and 1974. At this time, he recorded a song called \"Name it, You Got it\", which achieved some play on the British Northern soul scene. His other musical works include The Best We've Ever Had and Nearly Midnight, both written by Cross and directed by his son Theo.The original soundtrack for Nearly Midnight was written, produced and performed by his daughter Lauren. These works were performed in Edinburgh in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Square One, directed by Cross, was performed at the Etcetera Theatre in London in 2004. Personal life From 1977 to 1992, Cross was married to model Penelope Butler and had two children, Lauren and Theo. He was later married to gyrotonics trainer Michele Moerth, from 1996 to 2005. Both these marriages ended in divorce. In 2018, he married the Bulgarian artist Deyana Boneva, to whom he remained married until his death. In his later years, he lived primarily in Vienna, Austria. Cross was an active Freemason for the final 10 years of his life. Initiated in 2010 in the Shakespear Lodge (London), he attended lodge meetings in the United Kingdom and across Europe, eventually serving as a Grand Steward in the United Grand Lodge of England from 2017 to 2018.:\u200a18\u200a In this capacity he took part in the ceremonial tercentenary event at the Royal Albert Hall on 31 October 2017, celebrating three hundred years since the formation of the first English Grand Lodge, in which a dramatic presentation starred various actors, led by Sir Derek Jacobi, Samantha Bond, and Sanjeev Bhaskar. Death Cross died of cancer in Vienna on 18 August 2020, aged 72. He had recently finished two films, Prey for the Devil and The Last Letter from Your Lover, which were released posthumously.

Two years before, a parasite, Acarapis woodi that originated on the Isle of Wight had started to extend over the country, devastating all the native bees, and in 1916 it reached the abbey, killing 30 of the 46 bee colonies.He travelled to Turkey to find resistant native bees for selective breeding. In 1917 he created the first Buckfast strain, a very productive bee resistant to the parasite. On 1 September 1919 Kehrle was put in charge of the abbey's apiary, after the retirement of Brother Columban. In 1925 and after some studies on the disposition of the beehives he installed his famous breeding station in Dartmoor, an isolated model to obtain selected crossings, which still works today. From 1950 and for more than a decade Kehrle continued his gradual improvement of the Buckfast bee by analysing and crossing bees from places all over Europe, the Near East and North Africa.In 1964 he was elected member of the Board of the Bee Research Association, which later became the International Bee Research Association. He continued his studies of the Buckfast bee and his travels during the 1970s and received several awards, including appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (1973) and the German Bundesverdienstkreuz (1974). On 2 October 1987 he was appointed Honorary doctor by the Faculty of Agriculture of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences while in search of a bee on the Kilimanjaro mountains in Tanzania and Kenya, which deeply moved him and he saw as the official recognition of the scientific nature of his research. Two years later he was appointed Honorary doctor by the Exeter University in England. On 2 February 1992, aged 93, he resigned his post as beekeeper at the Abbey and was permitted to spend some months in his home town Mittelbiberach with his niece, Maria Kehrle. From 1993 onwards, he lived a retired life back at Buckfast Abbey, and became the oldest monk of the English Benedictine Congregation. In 1995, at age 97, he moved to a nearby nursing home where he died on 1 September 1996. Awards Honorary Doctorates 1987 Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences 1989 Exeter University in England.

In 1996, Tobias joined the touring band for Alanis Morissette and from 1999\u20132005 was a member of the musical duo, Splendid.  Life and career In 1990, Tobias formed the band Mother Tongue in Austin, TX. They were signed to record label in 1992. Anthony Kiedis of Red Hot Chilli Peppers spotted Tobias and Mother Tongue in a local nightclub, while they were looking for guitar player to replace John Frusciante. Dave Navarro had recently turned them down. Kiedis felt that Tobias had what the band was looking for and after months of long auditions (in which the band took out an ad in the newspaper), Tobias was on board as the new guitarist for the Chili Peppers. Tobias and the Peppers began writing for the next record; however, while the band felt Tobias was a great guitarist, the connection just wasn't there between Jesse and the other three, especially bassist Flea. At this time, Dave Navarro suddenly made himself available and the band fired Tobias, Kiedis saying that it would have happened regardless of Navarro becoming available. The band felt bad that they pulled Tobias away from a band he just joined only to fire him a month later.Tobias would resurface two years later with Alanis Morissette and would be her guitarist on her Jagged Little Pill world tour. While he was on tour with Morissette in 1996, he met Angie Hart, whose band Frente! was Morissette's opening act. The two were married in 1997 and moved to Los Angeles. Tobias continued to work as a session player, touring guitarist and in other non-performing roles in the music industry. The pair formed their own band, Splendid, which released an album in 1999. The album's release was largely received only in Australia; and the band's American exposure was largely due only to their association with Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, including on-camera appearances when Splendid performed at The Bronze, the fictional nightclub featured in the series. Tobias was credited as a producer (with Christophe Beck and Whedon) and with arranging the music (with Beck) for \"Once More, with Feeling\", the musical episode from Whedon's show's sixth season. Hart and Tobias ended their marriage in divorce in early 2005.Tobias joined Morrissey's touring band in 2004 after the illness of Alain Whyte and eventually became a permanent member of the group, having appeared on all studio recordings and live gigs since. He has also co-written several top-charting singles for Morrissey which includes You Have Killed Me, In The Future When All's Well, and All You Need Is Me. In 2020, Tobias worked with Morrissey on his upcoming album Bonfire of Teenangers, which was due to be released in February 2023, but in December 2022, it was announced that Capitol Records had backed out of the deal.

In the 2013 Knesset elections, the first contested by The Jewish Home under Bennett's leadership, the party won 12 seats out of 120.  Early life Bennett was born in Haifa, Israel, on 25 March 1972. He is the youngest of three sons born to Jim and Myrna (n\u00e9e Lefko) Bennett, American-Jewish immigrants who moved to Israel from San Francisco in July 1967. Both his parents were from Ashkenazi Jewish backgrounds. His father's ancestors were from Poland, Germany, and the Netherlands. Bennett's paternal great-great-great-grandfather Julius Salomonson was from \u0141ob\u017cenica, Poland, and arrived in San Francisco in 1851 during the California Gold Rush. His mother's ancestors lived in Russia and Poland, and her parents immigrated to the United States prior to World War II. They later moved to Israel, joining their daughter's family there, and settled on Vitkin Street in Haifa, close to where Bennett and his brothers grew up. Some of his mother's family members who remained in Poland were murdered in the Holocaust.Bennett's parents were raised in non-Orthodox Jewish homes and were progressive activists during the 1960s. His father was arrested while taking part in an anti-racism sit-in protest in 1964. They later began to observe Modern Orthodox Judaism and embraced right-wing Israeli politics. After moving to Israel in 1967, they volunteered for a few months at kibbutz Dafna, where they studied the Hebrew language, then settled in the Ahuza neighborhood of Haifa. Jim Bennett found a job in the Technion, working for its fundraising team, and became a successful real estate broker turned real estate entrepreneur. Myrna Bennett was the deputy director general of the Association of Americans and Canadians in Israel's northern region.In the summer of 1973, when Bennett was one year old, the family returned to San Francisco at the urging of his mother. With the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in October 1973, Jim Bennett returned to Israel to fight in the Israel Defense Forces, serving in an artillery unit on the Golan Heights front. Following the war, the rest of the family returned to Israel at his request as he was held in reserve duty for months after the war. Bennett's parents ultimately decided to stay permanently in Israel.In 1976, when Bennett was four years old, the family moved to Montreal for two years as part of his father's job. Upon returning to Haifa, Bennett began attending Carmel elementary school. When he was in second grade, the family moved to Teaneck, New Jersey for two years, again as part of his father's job. While living in New Jersey, Bennett attended Yavneh Academy. The family returned to Haifa when Bennett was ten.Bennett has two brothers; they are Asher, a former Israeli Navy submarine officer and businessman based in the United Kingdom, and Daniel, an accountant for Zim Integrated Shipping Services. Bennett attended Yavne Yeshiva High School in Haifa, and became a youth leader (madrich) with the religious Zionist youth organization Bnei Akiva. Military service Bennett was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces in 1990. He served in the elite Sayeret Matkal commando unit, and after his regular service was selected for officer training. He was given a choice of remaining in Sayeret Matkal but as a regular operator rather than a commander or transferring to the Maglan commando unit to receive a command position, and chose to transfer to Maglan. He became a company commander in the Maglan unit.Bennett was discharged from active service after six years but continued to serve in the reserves and attained the rank of major. During the time that Bennett was living in the United States and building his career as a software entrepreneur, he repeatedly traveled to Israel to do reserve duty. Bennett served during the First Intifada and in the Israeli security zone in Lebanon during the 1982\u20132000 South Lebanon conflict. He commanded many operations. Among other missions, he served as an officer in Operation Grapes of Wrath.After his regular IDF service, Bennett received a law degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. During the Second Intifada, he participated in Operation Defensive Shield.He was called up as a reservist in the Maglan special forces unit during the 2006 Lebanon War and participated in a search and destroy mission behind enemy lines, operating against Hezbollah rocket launchers.One of Bennett's actions as a commando officer became highly controversial. During Operation Grapes of Wrath, while leading a force of 67 Maglan soldiers operating in southern Lebanon, Bennett radioed for support after his unit came under mortar fire. The IDF launched an artillery barrage to cover his force, and the shelling hit a United Nations compound in which civilians were taking refuge, an incident that became known as the Qana massacre. A total of 106 Lebanese civilians were killed.The incident resulted in a wave of international condemnation, and the subsequent diplomatic pressure caused Israel to end Operation Grapes of Wrath sooner than planned. Journalist Yigal Sarna, writing in Israeli national tabloid Yedioth Ahronoth, argued that Bennett displayed \"poor judgement\" during the operation. Sarna wrote that \"Bennett led a force of 67 combat troops into Lebanon. At a certain point, he decided to ignore orders and change operational plans, without coordinating these moves with his superiors, who in his mind were cowardly, and not steadfast enough. Near the village of Kfar Kana, Bennett's troops were caught in an ambush.\"Citing a \"senior army figure\", journalist Raviv Drucker said that Bennett's radio call for support after his unit came under fire was \"hysterical\" and contributed to the loss of life which occurred. Bennett responded: \"I have now been subjected to an attack claiming that I am 'responsible for the massacre in Kfar Kana.' Heroism will not be investigated. Keep looking in the archives. My military file is available for viewing, and it's waiting for you.\" Former members of Bennett's unit wrote a letter defending him, saying: \"Naftali ... led many successful operations that led to the elimination of Hezbollah terrorists deep in enemy territory.\" Other officers involved in the operation, including one who was Bennett's deputy during the Qana incident, also denied that he had changed plans without consulting his superiors. Business career Bennett moved to the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 2000 to build a career as a software entrepreneur. In 1999, he co-founded Cyota, an anti-fraud software company, and served as its CEO. The company was sold in 2005 to RSA Security for $145 million, making Bennett a multimillionaire. A stipulation of the deal allowed the Israeli arm of Cyota to remain intact. As a result, 400 Israelis are employed at the company's Israeli offices in Beersheba and Herzliya.Bennett served as the CEO of Soluto, a technology company providing cloud-based service that enables remote support for personal computers and mobile devices in 2009, at a time when he and partner Lior Golan were engaged in raising funds for myriad Israeli technology startup companies. Soluto had hitherto raised $20 million from investors, including venture capital funds Giza Venture Capital, Proxima Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Index Ventures, Michael Arrington's CrunchFund, and Eric Schmidt's Innovation Endeavors and Initial Capital. The sale of Soluto for a reported $100\u2013130 million to the American company Asurion was finalized in October 2013.In June 2021, Forbes Israel reported that Bennett is expected to make $5 million from his investment in the American fintech company Payoneer. Bennett invested several hundred thousand dollars in the company before entering politics. Payoneer is set to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange with a $3.3 billion valuation after reaching a SPAC merger with FTAC Olympus Acquisition Corp in February 2021. Political career From 2010 to 2012, Bennett served as the director of the Yesha Council. In April 2011, together with Ayelet Shaked, he co-founded My Israel, which claims to have 94,000 Israeli members. In April 2012, he founded a movement named Yisraelim (\"Israelis\"). The movement's main goals include increasing Zionism among centre-right supporters, increasing dialogue between the religious and secular communities, and promoting \"The Israel Stability Initiative.\"Bennett was elected the leader of The Jewish Home party in 2012. He was reelected as the party's leader in 2015 and 2017.Following his election to the Knesset, and before he could take his seat, Bennett had to renounce his U.S. citizenship, which he held as the son of American parents. He was appointed Minister of Economy and Minister of Religious Services in March 2013. In April 2013, he was also appointed Minister of Jerusalem and Diaspora Affairs.After being reelected in the 2015 Knesset election, Bennett was appointed Minister of Education and retained the Diaspora Affairs portfolio in the new government. In May 2015, Netanyahu split the Ministry of Jerusalem and Diaspora Affairs, initially taking back the Jerusalem Affairs portfolio for himself. He later appointed Ze'ev Elkin to the role of Jerusalem Affairs Minister. As Minister of Education, Bennett issued an official order prohibiting school principals from inviting members of Breaking the Silence and other organizations that denounce Israel's military conduct in the West Bank.In October 2015, Bennett resigned from the Knesset in order to allow Shuli Mualem to take his seat. His resignation took place under the Norwegian Law, which allowed ministers to resign their seats when in the cabinet but return to the Knesset if they leave the government. He returned to the Knesset on 6 December after Avi Wortzman opted to vacate his seat, having temporarily had to resign as a minister in order to do so.Following Avigdor Lieberman's resignation as Defense Minister in November 2018, Bennett announced that he was seeking the position for himself. On 16 November 2018, a Likud party spokesman announced that Netanyahu had rejected Bennett's request and that Netanyahu himself would take the position instead. It was then announced that Bennett's Jewish Home party would no longer be affiliated with Netanyahu's government. On 19 November, Bennett reneged on his pledge to withdraw from Netanyahu's coalition.In December 2018, Bennett was among the Jewish Home MKs to leave the party and form the breakaway New Right party. In the April 2019 Knesset election, New Right narrowly failed to cross the electoral threshold; as a result, Bennett did not gain a seat in the 21st Knesset. In June 2019, he left the government after Netanyahu dismissed Bennett from his positions as Education and Diaspora Affairs Minister.After the Knesset dissolved and a second election in 2019 was called for September, the New Right formed an electoral alliance with the Jewish Home and National Union-Tkuma, named the United Right which was later renamed Yamina, and was led by Ayelet Shaked. The list won seven seats in the election, and Bennett regained his Knesset seat. In November 2019, Bennett rejoined Netanyahu's government as Minister of Defense. After briefly dissolving, the Yamina alliance was reunified in January 2020 ahead of the 2020 Knesset election, with Bennett succeeding Ayelet Shaked as the new leader of the alliance. Yamina won six seats in that election.In May 2020, with negotiations to form a new government between Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, leader of the centrist Blue and White alliance, Yamina announced that it would go into the opposition, ending Bennett's tenure as Defense Minister. The day before, Rafi Peretz, the leader of The Jewish Home, had split from the alliance, and would be named as the Minister of Jerusalem in the thirty-fifth government of Israel. On 17 May, Bennett met with Gantz, who also succeeded him as Defense Minister, and declared that Yamina was now a \"head held high\" member of the opposition. Tkuma, which rebranded as the Religious Zionist Party on 7 January 2021, split from Yamina on 20 January. In spite of this, Yamina won seven seats in the 2021 Knesset election in March. Prime Minister of Israel (2021-2022) On 9 May 2021, it was reported that Bennett and Leader of the Opposition and Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid had made major headway in coalition talks for forming a new Israeli government which would oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On 30 May, Bennett announced that he would serve as prime minister in a rotation government until August 2023, at which point Lapid would take over as prime minister until 2025. Bennett was sworn in on 13 June, ending Netanyahu's 12-year tenure in office. He is Israel's first kippah-wearing prime minister.On the fast of 9th of Av, 2021, as hundreds of Jews went to mourn on the temple mount, where it was forbidden for them to pray, Bennett wrote: \"The Jewish people twice had a Jewish state on the Land of Israel, and both times we did not succeed to complete the eighth decade as an independent state, because of internal wars and baseless hatred ... At the time of the Roman siege on Jerusalem, the nation was divided, each group entrenched itself in its own position, and burned the food stores of the others, as part of the internal power struggle, so the Romans had a much easier task. The bitter end we all know, and until today every year on this date we mourn the awful destruction which a people with a little more baseless love, restraint, and listening, could have saved us from.\" COVID-19 pandemic At the time of Bennett's assumption of office, the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel had somewhat subsided, with a low national infection rate and with 55% of the Israeli population having received two or more COVID-19 vaccines. Within ten days of his assumption of office, Israel underwent an outbreak of the Delta variant. In response, Bennett encouraged renewed social distancing, and the vaccination of all children aged twelve and above. In addition, he reached a deal with Pfizer to provide previously purchased vaccines before their intended delivery date to ensure the accessibility of the vaccine, and to provide additional vaccines in case a second booster shot becomes necessary. Following the variant's continued spread, a second booster shot and third overall shot was approved by the government on 1 August 2021 for all individuals aged 60 or older, which was expanded on 29 August to all adults.Israel experienced a surge in COVID cases beginning in late November 2021. By December, the first cases of the Omicron variant were being reported in the country, the government responded by restricting air travel to the country and encouraging the vaccination of children and teenagers. On 2 January 2022, following an additional surge in late December, a third booster shot, and a fourth overall shot, was approved by the government for all individuals aged 60 or older. Cases grew at a steady pace through January and began to decrease, stabilizing again in March before continuing to fall. Israel ended its mask mandate in late April. Foreign policy King Mohammed VI of Morocco sent a special congratulatory letter to Prime Minister Bennett upon his taking office. Bennett responded that he would \"work to reinforce Israeli-Moroccan relations in all areas\". Israel and Morocco restored diplomatic relations on 10 December 2020, as part of the Israel\u2013Morocco normalization agreement involving the United States, which at the same time recognized Morocco's sovereignty over the disputed territory of Western Sahara. In August 2021, the two parties agreed to enter formal diplomatic relations, and to open embassies in Tel Aviv and Marrakesh respectively.That month, Bennett made his first visit to the United States, where he met Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, and AIPAC CEO Howard Kohr. He subsequently met President Joe Biden on 27 August 2021. In this meeting, Bennett described Israel's strategy against Iran as \"a death by a thousand cuts\" or \"lingchi\".On 27 September, Bennett addressed the general assembly of the United Nations in his first speech there. He talked about fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and combatting political polarization. In addition, Bennett denounced Iran's alleged state-sponsored terrorism, which he argued brought harm not only to Israel but also to many countries in the Middle East. He warned of Iran's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons, stating that Israel would not allow it.On 12 December, he visited the United Arab Emirates in the first visit of the country by an Israeli Prime Minister, meeting with then crown prince of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, Mohamed bin Zayed. On 14 February 2022 he visited Manama, marking the first time an Israeli Prime Minister officially visited Bahrain.On 5 March 2022, Bennett met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in order to discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine in a meeting coordinated with the United States, France, and Germany. The Kremlin stated that Bennett had offered to mediate between Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Bennett then flew on the same day to Germany to brief German chancellor Olaf Scholz, updated French President Macron by telephone, and spoke with Zelenskyy twice in the evening, but few details were disclosed publicly. According to Al Monitor, the meetings were instigated by Scholz who made a lightning visit to Israel on 3 March and held a long one-on-one meeting, which resulted in the mediation idea. Natan Sharansky, former head of the Jewish Agency, criticised Bennett, saying he was afraid to call out Putin by name for war crimes, and said Israel should provide defensive arms to Ukraine. Bennett later faced criticism for putting himself forward as neutral mediator amid global condemnation of Putin, while refusing requests from Ukraine for military equipment. Political positions Bennett's positions have been described as \"ultra-nationalist\", and Bennett describes himself, and has been described, as \"more right wing\" than Netanyahu. He had also been labeled a \"pragmatist\" and an \"opportunist\". He opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, and supports cutting taxes. Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict In February 2012, Bennett published a plan to manage the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict called \"The Israel Stability Initiative.\" The plan was based in part on elements of earlier initiatives, such as \"Peace on Earth\" by Adi Mintz and the \"Elon Peace Plan\" by Binyamin Elon. It relied on statements of Netanyahu and Likud party ministers in favor of unilateral annexation of the West Bank. Bennett opposed the creation of a Palestinian state, saying: \"I will do everything in my power to make sure they never get a state.\"In January 2013, Bennett suggested a tripartition of the Palestinian territories, whereby Israel would unilaterally annex Area C, authority over the Gaza Strip would be transferred to Egypt, and Area A and Area B would remain with the Palestinian National Authority, but under the security umbrella of the Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet to \"ensure quiet, suppress Palestinian terrorism, and prevent Hamas from taking over the territory.\" Area C constituted 62% of the area, and approximately 365,000 people lived in Israeli settlements. Palestinians who lived in this area would be offered Israeli citizenship or permanent residency status (between 48,000, according to Bennett, and 150,000, according to other surveys).Finally, Israel would invest in creating roads so Palestinians could travel between Areas A and B without checkpoints, and invest in infrastructure and joint industrial zones, because \"[p]eace grows from below \u2014 through people, and people in daily life.\" Bennett also resisted immigration of Palestinian refugees now living outside the West Bank, or the connection between the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and the West Bank. In 2011, he stated that there were about 50 factories in the West Bank industrial region where Israelis and Palestinians work together, and cited this as one workable approach to finding peace between the two sides.In June 2013, Bennett suggested that Israel must learn to live with the Palestinian problem without a \"surgical action\" of separation to two states: \"I have a friend who's got shrapnel in his rear end, and he's been told that it can be removed surgically, but it would leave him disabled ... . So he decided to live with it. There are situations where insisting on perfection can lead to more trouble than it's worth.\" Bennett's \"Shrapnel in the butt\" quickly became widely known as representing his view of the Palestinian problem.In response to Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners in 2013, Bennett said that Palestinian terrorists should be shot, allegedly adding: \"I already killed lots of Arabs in my life, and there is absolutely no problem with that.\" Bennett was widely condemned for these words, although he denied saying them, claiming he said merely that \"terrorists should be killed if they pose an immediate life threat to our soldiers when in action.\" In January 2013, Bennett said: \"There is not going to be a Palestinian state within the tiny land of Israel [referring to the area from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea]. It's just not going to happen. A Palestinian state would be a disaster for the next 200 years.\"In December 2014, a group of academics who opposed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and members of The Third Narrative, a Labor Zionist organization, called on the U.S. and E.U. to impose sanctions on Bennett and three other Israelis \"who lead efforts to insure permanent Israeli occupation of the West Bank and to annex all or parts of it unilaterally in violation of international law.\" The academics, who called themselves Scholars for Israel and Palestine (SIP) and claimed to be \"pro-Israel, pro-Palestine, pro-peace\", asked the U.S. and EU to freeze Bennett's foreign assets and impose visa restrictions. Bennett was chosen as a target for proposed sanctions because of his work in opposing the 2010 settlement freeze while he was director of the Yesha Council, actively supporting annexation of over 60% of the West Bank, and \"pressing strongly for a policy of creeping annexation.\"In October 2016, Bennett said: \"On the matter of the Land of Israel, we have to move from holding action to a decision. We have to mark the dream, and the dream is that Judea and Samaria will be part of the sovereign State of Israel. We have to act today, and we must give our lives. We can't keep marking the Land of Israel as a tactical target and a Palestinian state as the strategic target.\" In November 2016, Bennett said that the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States gave him hope that the two-state solution would no longer be considered viable, claiming: \"The era of the Palestinian state is over.\"According to Israeli journalist Anshel Pfeffer, those who have worked with Bennett have privately said that much of his rhetoric is for electioneering purposes, and he is in fact more moderate than believed. In spite of his expressed right-wing views against a Palestinian state, while engaged in coalition negotiations for a unity government with Yair Lapid and other party leaders following the 2021 Knesset election, during which he was offered the prime ministership, Bennett agreed to a policy of not annexing any territory in the West Bank and to not build any new settlements while serving as prime minister in a potential unity government. Economy and society Bennett believes in less government regulation of the private sector and that private businesses are the engine of economic growth. He favors social support of vulnerable populations such as the elderly and disabled. Bennett has said Israel needs to break the monopoly of the tycoons, the major labor unions, and the Ministry of Defense, which in his opinion are strangling Israel's economy. He believes the key to reducing disparities is equality of opportunity and investment in education in the periphery, to give tools to populations of weaker economic backgrounds. By doing so, Bennett believes weaker populations in Israel will be given the opportunity to succeed professionally and financially. He supports the provision of land to veterans in the periphery, in the Negev, and the Galilee, to promote a national solution to the problem of \"affordable housing\" and a more equitable distribution of the population in Israel. He has also pledged to remove heavy bureaucratic challenges to small and medium-sized Israeli businesses.As Economy Minister, Bennett oversaw a new strategy by Israel to increase trade with emerging markets around the world and reduce trade with the European Union, so as to diversify its foreign trade. The two main reasons for this shift are to take advantage of opportunities in emerging markets and to avert the threat of possible EU sanctions on Israel over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Bennett acknowledged that he was seeking to reduce Israel's economic dependence on the EU to reduce its influence on Israel. According to the Financial Times, Bennett is the primary architect of this economic pivot. Under his leadership, the Economy Ministry began opening new trade attach\u00e9 offices in Asia, Africa, and South America, and also began closing some trade offices in Europe and consolidating others with offices in neighboring countries. As part of this process, Bennett opened negotiations with Russia and China on free trade agreements, oversaw continuing negotiations with India for a free trade agreement, and led economic delegations to China and India. While attending the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2013 in Bali, Indonesia, Bennett held talks with delegations from some unspecified countries on the possibility of future free trade agreements.Bennett implemented reforms to lower Israel's high food prices. Under his oversight, import duties and barriers were reduced, and mechanisms were set up to ensure more competition in the Israeli food industry. These reforms have been credited with a decline in Israeli food prices that began in April 2014 and continued throughout the rest of the year and into 2015. According to a Haaretz editorial, a fall in global commodity prices and dire financial straits among many Israeli consumers prompted the decline, not the reforms. Bennett has led a push to integrate Haredi men, many of whom are unemployed, into the workforce. According to Bennett, their integration into the workforce will greatly bolster economic growth. Under his \"voucher plan\", the Ministry of the Economy issues vouchers for hundreds of vocational schools that will allow Haredi men to avoid mandatory military service, at least temporarily, in exchange for enrolling in a vocational school to learn a trade. Bennett also wants to increase employment rate among Israeli-Arab women. In October 2021, Bennett's administration approved plans to spend billions of dollars to improve conditions for Israel's Arab minority.An adherent of Orthodox Judaism, Bennett opposes the implementation of same-sex marriage in Israel, \"just as we don't recognize milk and meat together as kosher\", but has expressed support for equivalent rights such as tax breaks for same-sex couples. Following the murder of a 16-year-old girl at the Jerusalem gay pride parade in 2015, Bennett, who was Education Minister at the time, instructed the Education Ministry to prepare programs to prevent future attacks on the LGBTQ community, saying: \"We are responding to this attack with actions and not just talk.\" While Bennett has voiced support for LGBTQ rights, saying \"they deserve all of the civil rights\", he stated in late 2020 that he had no plans to push for policy changes to help LGBTQ people. Personal life Bennett's wife, Gilat, is a professional pastry chef. She was secular, but following her husband she now observes the Sabbath and kashrut. The couple have four children and live in Ra'anana, a city 20 kilometres (12 mi) north of Tel Aviv. Their eldest son Yonatan is named after Yonatan Netanyahu, and their youngest son David Emmanuel is named after Emmanuel Moreno, who was a comrade of Bennett's in the special forces. Bennett adheres to Modern Orthodox Judaism.

Childhood Born in Frankenthal, Rhineland-Palatinate, Hell was a child prodigy, performing his first organ recital in Russia at the age of nine, and presenting concerts on the organ in many countries around the world before his 11th birthday. Beginning piano lessons at the age of seven, inspired by Bach's C-Major Prelude, his remarkable ability was quickly apparent. It was only eight months later he decided to undertake organ lessons. On Easter, during the year he was eight years old, he was on duty in his first service as a liturgical organist, playing the organ at a Roman Catholic High Mass. He has concertized extensively ever since. Competitions 1994 \"Jugend musiziert\" (Federal German competition for young musicians) Two first prizes in organ playing 1996 \"Jugend musiziert\" Two first prizes in piano playing 1997 \"Jugend musiziert\" Two first prizes in organ playing 1999 \"Jugend musiziert\" Two first prizes in piano playing Education From the very beginning, Hell's piano teacher has been Prof. Siegbert Panzer, German State Academy of Music, Mannheim. Felix has been formally educated by Eckard Mayer, at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Kirchenmusik Heidelberg, with Johannes Michel focusing on organ literature, and Christiane Michel focusing on improvisation. In this period of his education, he received additional training courses from professors Martin L\u00fccker, Frankfurt; Pieter van Dijk, Amsterdam; Oleg Yantchenko, Moscow; Wolfgang R\u00fcbsam, Chicago; Leo Kr\u00e4mer, Speyer; Franz Lehrndorfer, Munich; Robert Griffith, Delaware\/Ohio. In September 1999, Hell enrolled at the Juilliard School, New York, where he had been awarded a merit-based full tuition scholarship, studying organ with Matthew Lewis and piano with Frank Levy. From 2001 to 2004 Hell studied, again under full tuition scholarship, at The Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where he graduated in May 2004. Additional coaching while studying at Curtis by Martin Jean (Yale University), Donald Sutherland (Peabody Conservatory) and Marie-Claire Alain, Paris.

In September 2004, Hell enrolled in both the Master of Music and the Artist Diploma programs at the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, USA, studying under the guidance of Donald Sutherland, attending additional courses held by Joan Lippincott, Princeton University, and Gillian Weir, London. He has since graduated with both degrees. Hell is currently the resident organist at Lutheran Theological Seminary in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, as well as a professor of organ at nearby Gettysburg College. He also continues to concertize extensively. Besides his native German, Hell speaks perfect and unaccented English. His name, in German, means \"bright\", and he expressed amusement in the above-mentioned concert at Trinity Wall Street about finding out what his name meant in English when first coming to America. He went on to say that his dream is to someday found a conservatory for organ students, where the graduates will be able to say that they \"got their degree from Hell\". Performance schedule Hell maintains a rigorous schedule comprising performances all across the globe. While in Germany, he averages approximately seven performances\/recitals per month, and while in the United States, about 12. Hell has performed more than 650 recitals in Germany and abroad: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Korea, Spain, France, Italy, Russia, Latvia, Iceland, Norway, Jamaica, and the United States, where he has given more than 350 concerts in 42 states.

In later times, Widukind became a symbol of Saxon independence and a figure of legend.  Life Very little is known about Widukind's life. His name literally translates as \"child of the forest\". In the chronicles he is accompanied by Abbi who may have been a close relative. However, it is uncertain how they were related because all sources about him stem from his enemies, the Franks, who painted a negative picture representing him as an \"insurgent\" and a \"traitor\". While Widukind was considered the leader of the Saxon resistance by the Franks, his exact role in the military campaigns is unknown. According to the Royal Frankish Annals, the Franks campaigned in Saxony in 772, when Charlemagne ordered the destruction of the Irminsul sanctuary. The Saxon Wars continued when Westphalian tribes devastated the church of Deventer and the Angrarii laid siege to the Frankish court at Fritzlar. The king retaliated against the local nobility, enforcing the decree to incorporate the Saxon lands as a Frankish march. Widukind was first mentioned by the Annals in 777, when he was the only one of the Saxon nobles not to appear at Charlemagne's court in Paderborn. Instead, he stayed with the Danish king Sigfred (possibly Sigurd Hring). The next year, the Westphalians again invaded the Frankish Rhineland and subsequently fought a running battle against Charlemagne's forces and their local allies while the king was busy in Spain. By 782, Widukind had returned from Denmark and goaded the Saxon nobles into rebellion. From 782 to 784, battles between Saxons and Franks occurred annually, while Charlemagne had 4,500 Saxons executed at the Massacre of Verden. Widukind allied himself with the Frisians but Charlemagne's winter attacks of 784\/785 were nevertheless successful, and the dux and his allies were pushed back to their homelands. Charlemagne, leading an expedition towards the mouth of the Elbe, learned that Widukind was in the land of the Nordalbingians, on the right bank of the river. In the Bardengau in 785, Widukind agreed to surrender in return for a guarantee that no bodily harm would be done to him. He and his allies were then baptized, possibly in Attigny, with Charlemagne as his godfather. Widukind thereby reached a peace agreement and the acknowledgement of the Saxon noble rank by their Frankish overlords. There are no contemporary sources about Widukind's life or death after his baptism. Historian Gerd Althoff assumed that he was imprisoned at a monastery\u2014a fate that happened to other rulers deposed by Charlemagne. He tried to identify Reichenau Abbey as a likely location where Widukind may have spent the rest of his life, but his results are inconclusive and widely rejected. Alternatively, he may have received a position in the administration of occupied Saxony. The Vita Liudgeri biography of Saint Ludger mentions him accompanying Charlemagne on his campaign against the Veleti leader Dragovit. According to the 12th-century Kaiserchronik, he was slain by Charlemagne's brother-in-law Gerold of Baar. Legend Numerous legends developed around Widukind's life; he eventually appeared as a saintly figure (becoming \"Blessed Widukind\") and the builder of many churches. He was later assumed to have died in 807 or 808; his feast day is commemorated on January 6. According to legend, Widukind experienced a vision that led to his conversion. Disguised as a beggar, he was spying on Charlemagne's troop camp during Easter. He witnessed a priest performing a Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the priest was holding a beautiful child during the consecration. To his astonishment, people would receive communion and the priest would give the same child to each person. Widukind was dumbfounded by this scene and went to beg outside after the mass. One of the emperor's servants recognized Widukind behind his disguise\u2014due to an odd formation of one of his fingers\u2014and Widukind was captured. He was interrogated and confessed to spying on Charlemagne's camp for the purpose of becoming better acquainted with the Christian faith. He later confessed the divine vision he had seen. The emperor concluded that God had given Widukind the grace of witnessing the divine child, Jesus, behind the Sacred Host of the Mass. Widukind then renounced his worship of pagan idols. Later perception Medieval Since the 9th century, Widukind had been idolized as a mythical hero. Around 1100, a tomb for him was made in Enger; recent excavations have found that the contents of the tomb are indeed early medieval, but are the remains of a young woman. In 1971, archaeologists discovered three graves in a prominent place in front of the altar. The remains of three men who had died in the early 9th century, two of them about sixty-year-old warriors, the third a young man, were identified after a DNA analysis in 2002 as half-brothers or maternal cousins and a nephew. The man buried in front of the altar is assumed to be Widukind. When in the 10th century Saxon kings (of the Ottonian dynasty) replaced the Frankish kings in East Francia (the later Holy Roman Empire), these kings proudly claimed descent from Widukind: Matilda, the wife of King Henry I, was apparently a great-great-great-granddaughter of Widukind. The House of Billung, to which several Dukes of Saxony belonged, had Matilda's sister among its ancestors and thus also claimed descent from Widukind. The Italian family Del Carretto (and its supposed French branch, family de Charette) also claimed to descend from the hero. In German nationalism Widukind became a hero for German nationalists in the early 20th century. German neo-pagans saw him as an heroic defender of Germany's traditional beliefs and their gods, resisting the Middle Eastern religion of Christianity. Christian nationalists also lauded him, linking Charlemagne with the humiliation of French domination after World War I, especially the occupation of the Rhineland, portraying Charlemagne as a \"French\" invader.After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, so many plays and other works were written about Widukind that there were complaints that he was becoming a clich\u00e9. Alfred Rosenberg praised him as a hero of German freedom, who finally joined with the founder of the German Reich (Charlemagne). Two important plays about the Saxon leader were produced in 1934, Der Sieger by Friedrich Forster and Wittekind by Edmund Kiss. The first celebrated the conversion of Widukind, but the second caused controversy because of its explicit anti-Christian message. In that play after the massacre of Verden, Saxon leaders say, \"That is what the Christians have done; they feign love, but bring murder!\"\u2014a line that led to protests from the audience. The play portrays Catholic church leaders planning to destroy German freedom by forcing racial mixture on them, thus turning them into pliable \"Untermenschen\". Thousands of German maidens are captured and will be forced to mate with \"Jews and Moors\" unless Widukind converts, which he does only to avoid this horrifying prospect. He gives a speech saying that the survival of the German race was his principal concern, and that future generations will praise him for this when the true spirit of the German people arises once more.

She began writing in diaries, where she would detail her life on a daily basis, since she was eight years old. While she was a kid, her favorite activities included writing and producing scripts and plays, and writing music as well. Books Mayra wrote her first book, \"Fugala\u00e7a\", when she was seventeen years old. At age nineteen, her book was published by Editora Record (the largest publishing company in Latin America.)

Early life Nethercott was born in Newmarket, England. Having attended Mark Hall Comprehensive School, Harlow, and The Broxbourne School in Hertfordshire, Acer was admitted to University College, Oxford to study Physics and Philosophy as an undergraduate. He subsequently earned a BPhil and then a DPhil degree in philosophy. The Boat Race Nethercott took up rowing at Oxford University as a first year student but quickly switched to coxing when it became evident that his body type was more suited to that than pulling an oar. He became a member of both Oxford University Boat Club and Oxford University Women's Boat Club. He earned his first Blue when he steered the Oxford women's heavyweight blue boat to victory against Cambridge in 2000. The Oxford crew won by 21\u20444 lengths, and completed the Henley Boat Race course in a time of 6 minutes and 18 seconds. Nethercott steered Isis to victory in 2002. A year later, he stepped up to the Blue Boat, steering Oxford in the closest Boat Race in recent memory. In a thrilling finish Oxford won the 41\u20444 mile race by just a foot in a time of 18 minutes and 6 seconds. The race was also notable for it being the first time in history two sets of brothers competed against each other. David Livingston (Oxford) raced against his older brother James, and a last minute call up for Ben Smith (who joined the Cambridge Blue Boat from Goldie hours before the race after the original crew member was injured) meant that he competed against his brother Matthew, the Oxford president. In 2004, Nethercott won his seat in the Blue Boat after a tense internal competition with Peter Hackworth, the 2002 winning Blue Boat cox who had taken a year out to study in Italy. In a controversial race, in which the two boats clashed blades and the Oxford bowman came off his seat, Oxford lost by 6 lengths in a time of 18 minutes and 17 seconds. Nethercott's final Boat Race was in 2005. Both universities had extremely strong intakes that year, with Cambridge boasting several world champions and the Oxford crew including Olympic silver medallist Barney Williams. Oxford won the contest by 2 lengths in a time of 16 minutes 42 seconds. International coxing career Nethercott coxed the British Eight from 2005 to 2008, winning bronze at the 2007 World Rowing Championships in Munich.

During his career, he acted in 17 films and released \"dozens\" of albums. Shortly before his death, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Governor of Jakarta. Three of his songs were chosen by Rolling Stone Indonesia as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time.  Biography Ahmad Syech Albar was born in Cilegon, West Java (today in Banten province) on 27 September 1927 to Rintrik Achmad and his wife. As a child he was known as a class clown, often joking and winking. Although his father wanted him to be a doctor or an engineer, Albar decided to be an entertainer. At the age of twelve he began singing in the Terang Boelan orchestra in 1939. In 1944, he joined the Pantja Warna stage group and travelled through Yogyakarta, Malang and Surabaya.Albar took the name Bing Slamet in 1948 as a tribute to Bing Crosby, whom he respected; Bing was a reference to Crosby, and Slamet was his own nickname. Aside from singing, he also began to participate in comedy, forming the \"Los Gilos\" comic group together with Tjepot and Udel. On 29 July 1953, he won a comedy competition in the Jakarta Art Building, which gave him the nickname \"Bintang Pelawak\" (\"Star of Comedians\"), and two years later he was chosen as the best radio entertainer by the Radio Republik Indonesia branch in Jakarta. He eventually came on friendly terms with then-President Sukarno.Aside from comedy, Slamet also was active in acting and songwriting. In 1949 he performed in his first film, Mohammad Said Hamid Junid's Menanti Kasih (Waiting for my Love). His first starring role was in 1955's Di Simpang Jalan (At the Intersection).

He is buried in Karet Bivak cemetery, Central Jakarta. Accolades and awards In 1972, then-Governor of Jakarta Ali Sadikin gave Slamet a lifetime achievement award for his musical career. After Slamet's death, Titiek Puspa wrote \"Bing\" in 30 minutes on the airplane she was riding as a tribute to him. Rolling Stone Indonesia noted that Puspa was clearly emotionally devastated by his death. In 2003, Slamet was awarded the Budaya Parama Dharma medal. It was accepted by his son Hilmansyah.In 2009, Rolling Stone Indonesia listed three of Slamet's songs on their list of the 150 best Indonesian songs of all time.

His cover of \"Gendjer-Gendjer\", written by the Lekra-affiliated M. Arif, was ranked 105th; it was noted as being popular during the later years of Sukarno's rule, but deliberately ignored during Suharto's New Order regime. \"Nurlela\", the title track from Slamet's film Bing Slamet Tukang Becak (Bing Slamet the Pedicab Driver), was ranked 118th. \"Bing\" was ranked 41st.Slamet has been noted as directly or indirectly influencing numerous entertainers who followed him. His frequent collaborators Puspa and Benyamin Sueb learned from his experience and used it to further their own careers; Puspa has noted that meeting Slamet was the reason she entered singing, and Sueb is buried not far from Slamet. His songs have been covered by singers such as Glenn Fredly and Ruth Sahanaya.

He has directed numerous films ranging from comedy and drama to action thrillers.\nHe has directed 43 films.  Career 1990\u20131997 Ravikumar assisted various directors such as Bharathiraja, Vikraman, E. Ramdoss, Nagesh, Ramarajan and K. Rangaraj. Ravikumar worked as co-director on R. B. Choudary's production Pudhu Vasantham directed by Vikraman and the success of the film prompted the producer to give Ravikumar a chance to make his directorial debut. Ravikumar thus debuted as a film maker through Puriyaadha Pudhir (1990), a crime thriller starring Rahman and Raghuvaran. A remake of the Kannada film Tarka, the film won positive reviews upon release and remains as Ravikumar's only film outside the masala film genre. The success of the film meant that Ravikumar was able to expand his team of assistants and shortly after began work on a film under the same production house titled Pudhu Kaaviyam with Vikram in the lead role, though the venture was later shelved. He subsequently switched his genre of films to make a series of village action entertainers and regularly collaborated with actor Sarath Kumar, scoring successes with Cheran Pandiyan (1991) and Nattamai (1994), after which he became a highly sought after film maker in the Tamil film industry.Ravikumar then signed on to make Muthu (1995), adapting Priyadarshan's Malayalam film Thenmavin Kombath, for a film produced by K. Balachander and starring Rajinikanth. Despite buying the official remake rights, he worked on his own screenplay, and the film consequently went on to gain \"cult classic\" status in India and Japan, as well as becoming one of the most profitable Tamil films till date at release. Soon after he worked with Kamal Haasan for the first time in Avvai Shanmugi (1996), an Indian adaptation of the American comedy film, Mrs. Doubtfire. The film, also featuring Meena and Gemini Ganesan, won positive reviews and performed well at the box office. The Hindu praised the film claiming \"turns out to be entertainer, mouthful from start to finish\". The success of his two films with the two leading Tamil actors prompted further opportunities in big productions in 1997, notably Vijayakanth's Dharma Chakkaram and the comedy Pistha featuring Karthik. 1998\u20132010 In December 1997, Ravikumar announced his next project Padayappa (1999) would feature Rajinikanth again as the lead actor with Sivaji Ganesan also in a pivotal role. Though principal photography for the film was supposed to have started in April 1998, the FEFSI strike that took place at that time delayed the project. After the strike ended, Ravikumar was able to complete Arjun's Kondattam and the successful drama with Sarath Kumar, Natpukkaga (1998). The film was further delayed when Ravikumar accepted to quickly remake Natpukkaga in Telugu as Sneham Kosam (1999) with Chiranjeevi in the lead. The shoot of Padayappa began in November 1998 and was subsequently completed in three months, with the film became a blockbuster upon release, as well as earning positive reviews from critics. Following the success of Padayappa, producer K. R. Gangadharan signed Ravikumar to direct a film and was insistent that the title should be Minsara Kanna (1999), after the popular song from Ravikumar's earlier film. His only collaboration with actor Vijay till date, the film opened to below average reviews collections. He then completed the village action film Paattali (1999) with Sarath Kumar within a month, as well as directing a portion of the record-breaking comedy drama Suyamvaram, bringing his release count for the year to five. Ravikumar consequently worked on his first home production through the comedy film Thenali (2000), starring Kamal Haasan in the titular role. While his wife Karpagam produced the film under his home studio RK Celluloids, Ravikumar worked on the screenplay and direction for the film also starring Jayaram, Jyothika and Devayani. Completing the film swiftly despite avid publicity, Thenali won critical and commercial acclaim, prompting grand felicitations of the director at the success meet. In 2001, he had two releases; the Telugu marital comedy Bava Nachadu and the family drama Samudhiram, in which he worked with Sarath Kumar again. In 2002, Ravikumar made a third collaboration with Kamal Haasan through the comedy drama Panchathanthiram, which was produced by his manager P. L. Thenappan. Telling the story of five friends and a trip to Bangalore which goes awry, the film opened to rave reviews and made profits at the box office. Villain (2002), his first film featuring Ajith Kumar, was shot swiftly within forty days and also became a blockbuster upon release. He later remade the film in Telugu in 2003 under the same name with Rajasekhar in the lead role, after finishing Paarai (2003), another village action film with Sarath Kumar. In 2004, he began production on a third film starring Rajinikanth titled Jaggubhai. Ravikumar spent six months on pre-production works and missed out on the opportunity to direct Kamal Haasan in Vasool Raja MBBS during the period, but the film was later shelved after a photo shoot. Rajinikanth had asked for changes to the script and after several months of tinkering, the pair decided to part ways and abandon the project. He moved on to make Aethiree (2004), a film about an imposter gangster with Madhavan, before agreeing terms with NIC Arts to make a follow up film with Ajith Kumar in three roles from November 2004, after Villain's success. Despite beginning production soon after the launch, financial problems meant that it progressed slowly and Varalaru, only had a theatrical release in late 2006. The film, however, won positive reviews and became the blockbuster hit for Ajith until that date. In between, he worked quickly on another action drama, Saravana (2006) with Silambarasan, a remake of the Telugu film Bhadra (2005).Ravikumar collaborated with Kamal Haasan again in the high-budget venture Dasavathaaram (2008), where the actor portrayed ten different roles. Revealing that the film was an action adventure, encompassing mankind's concern for the environment, science and faith, Dasavathaaram became Ravikumar's most expensive and lengthy shoot till date. The film opened to positive reviews and became the most profitable Tamil film of 2008, with Ravikumar's work garnering a Filmfare Best Tamil Director Award nomination. Aadhavan (2009) featuring Suriya and Nayantara was his next release, and it saw him return to his standard \"commercial packaging\" and the film performed well at the box office. His shelved venture, the family-drama Jaggubhai (2010), re-began shoot with Sarath Kumar and Shriya Saran in mid 2008 but delays meant that the film was only released in January 2010, after a leaked copy had found itself online. He made a further collaboration with Kamal Haasan again in the romantic comedy Manmadan Ambu (2010), though the film opened to mixed reviews and collections. 2013\u20132019 After he completed his work, he began production on his first Hindi film, adapting director Hari's Tamil film Saamy in a venture titled Policegiri (2013) with Sanjay Dutt in the lead role. However, despite a high profile launch, production was troubled as a result of Dutt's impending arrest. Subsequently, the film was rushed with Ravikumar only able to use ten days of Dutt's forty-day schedule for the film, and the director noted he mentally prepared himself for the subsequent box office failure. In January 2014, a felicitation event titled Endrendrum Ravikumar was held at the Nehru Indoor Stadium marking the director's 25th year in the industry and was attended by several of Ravikumar's contemporaries and colleagues. Following the completion of Kochadaiiyaan, Ravikumar began work on a new venture titled Lingaa (2014) with Rajinikanth, rather than reviving Rana. Signing on Anushka Shetty and Sonakshi Sinha in other lead roles, production began in May 2014 and period scenes were shot around sets in Karnataka. The film was completed in a period of 120 days, considerably shorter than any other film of equal budget or film starring Rajinikanth in recent times and opened to successful collections commercially. Prior to release, Ravikumar and his scriptwriter Ponkumaran, successfully evaded legal action from claims of plagiarism regarding the script. He has directed featuring Sudeep, a bilingual film Mudinja Ivana Pudi in Tamil and Kotigobba 2 in Kannada language as the lead role. Both languages of the film have been successful in their industry. He later directed two Telugu actions films with Nandamuri Balakrishna in Jai Simha (2018) and Ruler (2019). 2020\u2013present After Ayya Ullen Ayya (2020) and Naan Sirithal (2020), K. S. Ravikumar makes a solid start in his first-ever film Mathil (2021) as the lead. Style of working Production Ravikumar's films are usually in the masala genre, with action, family sentiment, comedy, betrayal, revenge and redemption appearing as key themes. The decision against marking art films was a self-made decision, despite making his debut with a significantly different thriller in Puriyaadha Pudhir. Ravikumar has often associated with the same team of writers and assistants since his early career, with actor-director Ramesh Khanna being a near constant fixture in his team since a shelved venture titled Pudhu Kaaviyam was announced in 1990. Rather than considering his original storylines, Ravikumar has primarily gathered plots from other writers, refined them and adapted them into screenplays. He has also regularly associated with Erode Soundar in village action films, M. A. Kennedy in romantic comedies and Crazy Mohan in ventures featuring Kamal Haasan. Ravikumar often works on the script with his own story discussion team, away from his assistant directors, revealing that writing was \"a personal process\". However, for the production of Lingaa (2014), he revealed that the rush to finish the film by December 2014, meant he was unable to stay solely focused on the script and ventured out to help his assistants scout locations and arrange schedules.Ravikumar is renowned for his quick schedules and his prompt completion of films, with Sify noting he is often considered a \"film producer's delight\" for his ability to stay within time and budget allotments. He made an exception for his quick paced schedules with Kamal Haasan's Dasavathaaram (2008), indicating it was significantly more difficult to make than his previous ventures and involved extensive simultaneous CGI work to production. The shooting for Lingaa, one of the most expensive films in Tamil film history, was completed within 120 days. The duration was significantly smaller than any other Tamil film of equal budget, as well as for any recent film starring a leading actor, such as Rajinikanth, in the main role. Ravikumar has also made cameo appearances in most of his directorial ventures, likening them to Alfred Hitchcock's cameo appearances. Approach to actors Ravikumar has often chosen to work with established actors rather than newcomers, indicating that they are commercially more viable than newcomers, and are easier to handle them as they are more experienced. He has regularly worked on his scripts only after finalising the lead actor, adding changes in the original plot line in order to blend it into the actor's image. Describing his collaborations with Rajinikanth, Ravikumar noted he ensured that each scene was discussed with the actor during the making of Padayappa (1999) and that Rajinikanth decided exactly where to place punch dialogues in order to attract audiences. Referring to his work with Kamal Haasan, he noted that the actor would describe a detailed scene on how to make his core audience of \"city-slickers\" laugh during the making of Thenali (2000) and Panchatanthiram (2002), and then request Ravikumar to add a slapstick element to make it applicable to village audiences too. Ravikumar has also often collaborated with Sarath Kumar, who has since dedicated his success to the director's opportunities, with the pair working on several quickly shot village action films in the 1990s.Ravikumar's temper with technicians has often been described to be \"constantly on the edge\", with assistant directors often remarking that Ravikumar yells regularly on set to ensure the production team work more efficiently. Director Cheran revealed that during his stint as an assistant director, he fell out with Ravikumar and was subsequently left out of the team of Purusha Lakshanam (1993) after irking the director.

Brack was Art Master at Melbourne Grammar School (1952\u20131962). His art first achieved prominence in the 1950s. He also joined the Antipodeans Group in the 1950s which protested against abstract expressionism. He was appointed Head of National Gallery of Victoria Art School (1962\u20131968), where he was an influence on many artists and the creation of the expanded school attached to the new gallery building. Style Brack's early conventional style evolved into one of simplified, almost stark, shapes and areas of deliberately drab colour, often featuring large areas of brown. He made an initial mark in the 1950s with works on the contemporary Australian culture, such as the iconic Collins St., 5 pm (1955), a view of rush hour in post-war Melbourne. Set in a bleak palette of browns and greys, it was a comment on the conformity of everyday life, with all figures looking almost identical. A related painting The Bar (1954) was modelled on Manet's 1882 A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re, and satirised the six o'clock swill, a social ritual arising from the early closing of Australian pubs. Most of these early paintings and drawings were unmistakably satirical comments against the Australian Dream, either being set in the newly expanding post-war suburbia or taking the life of those who lived there as their subject matter. In the 1970s Brack produced a long series of highly stylised works featuring objects such as pencils in complex patterns. These were intended as allegories of contemporary life. Period and themes Brack's works cover a wide range topics and themes. He often did a series of works on a particular theme over a number of years. His portraits, including self-portraits, and portraits of family, friends and commissions, and his paintings of nudes were produced throughout his career.

Early life and career Cauty was born on the Wirral Peninsula. As a 17-year-old artist, he drew a popular The Lord of the Rings poster (and later, a counterpart based on The Hobbit) for British retailer Athena.In 1981\u201382 Cauty was guitarist in a band called Angels 1\u20135, who recorded a Peel session on 1 July 1981. Lead vocalist was Cressida Bowyer, whom Cauty later married. He then joined the band Brilliant with which he remained until its break-up in 1986. Cauty was also an original member of Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction, in 1985. Artistic partnership with Bill Drummond Cauty joined with Bill Drummond to form The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs), a collaboration that played out in various guises and media over much of the next decade. As an A&R man, Drummond had signed Brilliant to WEA. Concocting a scheme for a hip-hop record on New Year's Day 1987, Drummond needed a like-minded collaborator with expertise in current music technology, and so contacted Cauty. Drummond later commented that Cauty \"knew exactly, to coin a phrase, 'where I was coming from'\". A week later, The JAMs had recorded their debut single, \"All You Need Is Love\". Several singles and three albums as The JAMs followed (their debut, 1987; the follow-up, Who Killed The JAMs?; and compilation Shag Times) before a change of direction saw the duo mutate into dance and ambient music pioneers, The KLF. The duo had their first British number one hit single as The Timelords with the Gary Glitter\/Dr. Who novelty-pop mash-up \"Doctorin' the Tardis\", claimed to be sung by Cauty's 1968 Ford Galaxie American police car. During this period, Cauty also worked with Tony Thorpe of The Moody Boys; besides remix and production work by the Moody Boys for The KLF and vice versa, Thorpe and Cauty recorded the single \"Journey into Dubland\" together at the KLF's Trancentral studios.The KLF released two albums, Chill Out and The White Room, and a string of top 5 singles, becoming the biggest selling singles act in the world in 1991. In 1992, suddenly and very publicly, The KLF retired from the music industry and deleted their entire back catalogue.Drummond and Cauty re-emerged in 1993 as the K Foundation, releasing one limited edition single (\"K Cera Cera\") and awarding the \u00a340,000 K Foundation art award for the \"worst artist of the year\". In 1994, the duo courted infamy by setting fire to one million pounds in cash on the Scottish island of Jura. In 1995, they undertook a screening tour of a film of the burning, before signing a moratorium on K Foundation activities.Cauty worked with Drummond again in 1997 with a campaign to \"Fuck the Millennium\", the highlight of which was a 23-minute live performance satirising the \"pop comeback\", in which Cauty and Drummond appeared as grey-haired pensioners and wheeled around the stage in electric wheelchairs. They returned as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu in 2017, with a novel - 2023: A Trilogy - and a 3-day festival, \"Welcome to the Dark Ages\". Cauty confirmed that the duo's work is an ongoing project.Throughout their career, Drummond has often been the mouthpiece of the group and was sometimes viewed, subjectively, as their chief protagonist. NME, for example, wrote: \"One suspects that the real boiling genius of the duo is initiated by Drummond. The elements of the K Foundation affair are classic Drummond \u2013 honesty mixed with deranged publicity-seeking, pop terrorism ideas mixed with utter strangeness and mysticism..., and a sense that the things pop groups do should be visionary and above all should not be mundane.\" However, the initial idea for the K Foundation's one million incineration was Cauty's, although he was beginning to express regret in 1995 at which time Drummond remained resolute.Contrasting with Drummond's image, Jimmy Cauty was perceived, or presented, as \"Rockman Rock \u2013 cool dude\"; the \"quiet\", enigmatic one, a \"long-haired and quietly spoken chain-smoker: a leather-jacketed misfit [who] has carried his adolescent rock obsession into adulthood\". However, as the previously quoted NME piece cautioned, \"We can't underestimate the importance of Jimmy Cauty\". Cauty was the musical bedrock of The KLF, whether laying down the starting track for \"Doctorin' the Tardis\", or playing electric guitar, bass, drums and keyboard on \"America: What Time Is Love?\". He and his wife, Cressida, were at the centre of KLF operations, living and working at Trancentral (actually the Cautys' squat in Stockwell, London) and driving the \"JAMsmobile\" (Cauty's 1968 Ford Galaxie American police car) as their regular, everyday vehicle. Cressida, too, helped out, taking on an organisational role for KLF Communications, in addition to design and choreography work for The KLF, and her own work as an artist.Engineer Mark Stent recalled Drummond as providing \"big concepts and insane ideas\", whereas Cauty - he said - was \"literally a musical genius\".John Higgs wrote in The KLF: Chaos, Magic and the Band who Burned a Million Pounds that: A simplified description of their partnership would portray Cauty as the musician and Drummond as the strategist, but this view doesn't hold up to scrutiny. All of the products of their partnership, whether musical or otherwise, came out of mutual agreement. Cauty is just as capable of burning stuff as Drummond.... Cauty is practical and above all curious, quick to get his hands dirty, experiment and see what happens. He is a catalyst.:\u200a95\u201396\u200a Ambient house, 1988\u20131992 In the late 1980s, Cauty met Alex Paterson and the duo began DJing and producing together as The Orb. Paterson and Cauty's first release was a 1988 acid house anthem track, \"Tripping on Sunshine\" released on the compilation Eternity Project One, put together by Paterson's childhood friend and Cauty's ex-bandmate, Martin \"Youth\" Glover. The following year, The Orb released the Kiss EP, a four-track EP based on samples from New York City's Kiss FM on Paterson and Youth's new record label WAU\/Mr. Modo Records.After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as \"really shit drum sounds\", the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by \"taking the bloody drums away\". Paterson and Cauty began DJing in London and landed a deal in 1989 for The Orb to play the chill-out room at London nightclub Heaven. Resident DJ Paul Oakenfold brought in the duo specifically as ambient DJs for his \"The Land of Oz\" event at Heaven.Though initially The Orb's Monday night performances had only several \"hard-core\" followers, their \"Chill Out Room\" act grew popular over the course of their six-month stay at Heaven to the point that the small room was often packed with around 100 people. The Orb's performances became especially popular among weary DJs and clubbers who sought solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor. The Orb would build up melodies using multitrack recordings linked to multiple record decks and a mixer. They incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and BBC sound effects into their act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as \"Sue\u00f1o Latino\". Most often, they played dub and other chill out music which Bill Drummond described as \"Ambient house for the E generation.\"Throughout 1989, Paterson, Cauty, Drummond and Youth developed the musical genre of ambient house through the use of a diverse array of samples and recordings. The culmination of Cauty and Paterson's musical work came towards the end of the year when The Orb recorded a session for John Peel on BBC Radio 1. The track, then known as \"Loving You\", was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from science fiction radio plays, nature sounds, and Minnie Riperton's \"Lovin' You\". The Orb changed the title to \"A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld\". In 1990, Cauty and Drummond held a chillout party at Trancentral, Cauty's squat. A recording of Patersons DJing was made with a view to releasing it as an LP but the mix contained many uncleared samples and other records and was unusable. Later that year Cauty and Drummond went to the isle of Jura, Scotland to record a techno record called Gate. Instead they created a long form ambient film called Waiting (1990). During the same year Cauty and Drummond went into the studio and made the ambient LP Chill Out. The Grove Dictionary suggests Chill Out to be the first ambient house album.When offered an album deal by Big Life, The Orb found themselves at a crossroads. Cauty preferred that albums by The Orb were released on his KLF Communications label, whereas Paterson wanted to ensure The Orb did not become an offshoot of The KLF. Due to these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name The Orb. Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the recordings in progress and released the album as Space on KLF Communications. Post-KLF In 1999 Cauty produced several remixes under the alias The Scourge of the Earth for Placebo, Marilyn Manson, Hawkwind, Ian Brown, The Orb, and others. In December 1999 he joined with Guy Pratt, Lloyd Stanton and Denise Palmer to record and release a mobile telephone-themed novelty-pop record \"I Wanna 1-2-1 With You\" under the name Solid Gold Chartbusters. It was released as competition for the Christmas Number One but only reached Number 62 in the UK Singles Chart.In 2001, Cauty joined with former collaborators Alex Paterson and Pratt in a London recording studio, together with Dom Beken, an associate of Pratt. Recording later continued in Cauty's Brighton studio. In 2003, the group released their first single, \"Boom Bang Bombay\", under the name Custerd. Subsequently, they settled on the name \"Transit Kings\". Cauty left the band in 2004 to work on other projects. Two years later, the Transit Kings released their debut album, Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God; Cauty is listed as a composer on seven of the album's 12 tracks.In 2002, Cauty's two remixes of U2's \"New York\" were featured as B-sides on the band's Electrical Storm single. Art Cauty was, until mid-2005, part of art\/music collective Blacksmoke, together with James Fogarty and manager Keir Jens-Smith.Cauty works with the L-13 Light Industrial Workshop, London which he explains \"is not a gallery, it\u2019s a support system, spiritual home and technical epicentre for a small group of artists\" which includes Billy Childish, Jamie Reid, and Harry Adams. Cauty first worked in conjunction with L-13 on the Cautese Nation\u00e1l Postal Disservice. Subsequent collaborations included the Riot in a Jam Jar exhibitions and the ADP Riot Tour - is a vast 1:87 scale model in a 40-foot shipping container which tours historic riot sites around the world. L-13 continue to collaborate with Cauty and Drummond, running \"dead perch merch\", official merchandise operatives to The JAMs.Following 2003 media speculation that Saddam Hussein could launch a poison chemical attack on London, Cauty designed the Stamps of Mass Destruction for Blacksmoke Art Collective. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd class stamps featuring the Queen's head wearing a gas mask were released as limited edition prints and exhibited at Artrepublic Gallery, Brighton. Following a legal battle over alleged copyright infringement, the stamps were sent to Royal Mail for destruction.In 2004, Cauty installed a gift shop, Blackoff, at the Aquarium Gallery, based on the UK government's Preparing for Emergencies leaflet. The installation included \"terror aware\" items, such as \"terror tea towels\", \"attack hankies\" and \"bunker-buster jigsaw puzzles\" (the latter missing one piece). He commented, \"The gift shop becomes the place we can explore our branding ideas, Cash for trash \u2013 it represents the futility and the glory of it all.\" In response to the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, Cauty developed Operation Magic Kingdom, a series of images showing US forces in Iraq wearing masks of lovable and friendly Disney characters, adopting the UK's \"winning hearts and minds\" tactics in a bid to gain the confidence of the Iraqi people. In Operation Magic Kingdom \"the rules of engagement have been changed to include 'try and be more fun' before firing.\" The images were launched at the Bayswater Road Sunday Art Exhibition, bombed onto billboards and fly-posted across London, as well as being released by The Aquarium as limited edition prints and stamps.In June 2011 he held a public exhibition at L-13 entitled A Riot in a Jam Jar consisting of a series of scale dioramas depicting violent confrontations between British rioters and police, each contained within an inverted glass jar. In 2012, Cauty premiered his short film, Believe the Magic, starring Debbie Harry, Nick Lehan and Branko Tomovi\u0107, at Tate Modern as part of the annual Merge festival. The ideas of A Riot in a Jam Jar evolved into the Aftermath Dislocation Principle, shown at the Hoxton Arches in October 2013. The 448-square-foot installation at 1:87 scale (representing approximately one square mile) details the desolate and charred aftermath of what appears to have been a devastating riot. The sculpture, constructed by modifying components of traditional model railway kits, took approximately 8 months to complete includes nearly 3,000 police figures and a soundtrack pitched to match the 1:87 scale. The piece \"makes a political statement about societal freedom and state control\". The Aftermath Dislocation principle then toured the Netherlands, being shown at Piet Hein Eek Gallery, Eindhoven (November 2013), Cultuurwerf, Vlissingen (April 2014), and Mediamatic, Amsterdam (July\u2013August 2014).In 2015, the work was exhibited at Banksy's Dismaland and then in London. Following this it was re-engineered to fit inside a 40-foot shipping container and now tours historic riot sites around the world.In 2014, Cauty released a series of limited edition Smiley Riot Shields. Each are all ex-police riot gear painted over with a yellow smiley face. He originally designed the shields in 2012 as a symbol of \"non-violent direct action\" and as a practical self-protective measure for his step-daughter during the Occupy St Paul's eviction. Personal life Cauty was married to Cressida (n\u00e9e Bowyer), with whom he has twins, Daisy and Harry, and a younger son, Alfie. He later married artist and musician Alannah Currie (formerly of Thompson Twins) in 2011.

Early life and education Helen Irene Clevenger was born November 4, 1917, in Washington, DC, to Joseph F. Clevenger and Mary, n\u00e9e Desbach\/Dresbach. Both parents were born in Ohio and married in 1902 in Columbus, while they were employed as teachers. Using materials from Ohio Joseph created a study of Phyllachora fungi he published in 1905 as well as a brief article on using hydrochloric acid to prepare slides. Infants of the Clevengers had died in 1910 and 1915 while they were living in Chicago and then back in Ohio. In between Joseph was a teacher in a college while they lived in Chicago. By 1918 Joseph was visible working from DC with the Pharmacognosy Laboratory of the Department of Chemistry, in the Department of Agriculture, often publishing with Clare Olin Ewing until she left the department in 1919. Joseph registered for WWI draft September 12, 1918, in DC. The Clevengers were living on 5th St NW and he was employed in the Bureau of Chemistry in the Department of Agriculture. In 1920 the Clevenger family was still there along with three other roomers in 1920. Joseph continued working with the Pharmacognosy Laboratory in DC through 1925. In 1927 Joseph finished a map of the travels of the B\u00e1b and Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, founders of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, published in volume 2 of The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World as approved of by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion. In 1930 the Clevengers owned a home worth $5500 in 1930 dollars, (over $88000 in 2021 dollars) on Howton Ave in the unincorporated town of Great Kills, Staten Island, and he was employed as a scientist with the federal government. By January 1932 Joseph was visible as a pharmacognosist at the New York Station of the Federal Food and Drug Administration in which he continued service into at least 1935.Clevenger had been raised a member of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, the religion of the family, and graduated from Tottenville High School in 1934. She was a member of the school honors association Arista, editor in chief of the high school Digest and Valedictorian. She was one of 76 students receiving a certificate for participating in high school math competition for New York, and July 1 was announced as one of 39 students awarded scholarships at New York University for the 1936-7 school year. She continued her education at New York University, planning to follow her father as a chemist. The family lived on Howton Ave, on Staten Island. Death and aftermath Helen's father said \"\u2026 for fear I was binding my daughter too much to my life and my ideas, I arranged for her to visit her relatives in North Carolina and travel some with her uncle Billy.\" She was then in Asheville, North Carolina traveling with her uncle, William Leander Clevenger, 1881-1951, a professor at North Carolina State College. Clevenger's \"upturned face was a bloody pulp\". Clevenger's death certificate noted she died of a gunshot wound by a .32 caliber bullet through an autopsy while at the Battery Park Hotel with the name Helen I. Clevenger of Great Kills, Staten Island, NY, and died July 16, 1936 around 1am. She was found wearing a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed ring with the ringstone symbol. Inquiries with the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds based on the coverage were noted in New York.By July 23 press coverage was already significant with reporters phoning or telegraphing stories in across the nation. London papers called about the story and it was reported European papers had the news in their newspapers too. The local police interviewed many witnesses and possible suspects in the killing before finally arresting a relatively-new, 22-year-old negro hotel night janitor, Martin Moore. Moore claimed that he was beaten by detectives into giving a written confession when he was really innocent. Moore was executed in the gas chamber in Raleigh, North Carolina on December 11, 1936.The sheriff informed newspaper reporters on Sunday August 9 and some had paid for access to the story. The photographer for the newspaper coverage of the confession and re-enactment was the only job he ever did as a photographer. A multi-page review of the case was published in 1942. Her mother died in 1943 after years of medical complications and her father in 1945, retired from the government job about a year. Dramatizations Dramatizations were written up in true crime magazines starting in October 1936 including True Detective A version was written and approved of by the sheriff in a radio drama aired in April and July 1937. A 2014 play was written on the incident. Modern interest Literature present ghost stories mentions Clevenger haunts where she was killed, the Battery Park Hotel, now Battery Park Apartments since 1996 and up to 2015.The Asheville \"Tourism Center and Free Museum\" run by Joshua P. Warren in 2010 had an exhibit on Clevenger as an unsolved murder. Anne Chesky Smith of the University of Georgia has presented in academic circles on the murder, trial, and Moore's execution, in 2016.The Citizen-Times newspaper of Asheville has referred to the case a few times: 2015 and 2019. So did the New York Daily Times in 2017. There is also speculation it was a case of mistaken identity in 2017, and referred to in another short-fiction contest story. The Southern Mysteries podcast carried the case in 2019, as did history focused review with a point of view on the case, with a third in 2020. Further reading Smith, Anne Chesky (2021).

He was also a politician, and a member of the Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland.  Personal life Born in London, England, Ricardo was the third surviving of the 17 children of successful stockbroker Abraham Israel Ricardo (1733?\u20131812) and Abigail (1753\u20131801), daughter of Abraham Delvalle (also \"del Valle\"), of a respectable Sephardic Jewish family that had been settled in England for three generations as \"small but prosperous\" tobacco and snuff merchants, and had obtained British citizenship. Abigail's sister, Rebecca, was wife of the engraver Wilson Lowry, and mother of the engraver Joseph Wilson Lowry and the geologist, mineralogist, and author Delvalle Lowry. The Ricardo family were Sephardic Jews of Portuguese origin who had recently relocated from the Dutch Republic. Ricardo began working with his father at the age of 14. At the age of 21 Ricardo eloped with a Quaker, Priscilla Anne Wilkinson, and, against his father's wishes, converted to Unitarianism. This religious difference resulted in estrangement from his family, and he was led to adopt a position of independence. His father disowned him and his mother apparently never spoke to him again.Following this estrangement he went into business for himself with the support of Lubbocks and Forster, an eminent banking house. He made the bulk of his fortune by profitably financing Government borrowing. There is a story that he made his fortune as a result of speculation on the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo: The Sunday Times reported in Ricardo's obituary, published on 14 September 1823, that during the battle Ricardo \"netted upwards of a million sterling\", a huge sum at the time, and this was later popularised by the economist Paul Samuelson; in reality Ricardo was already very rich and in June 1815 sold his latest government stock before the result of the battle was known in London, so missing half of the rise.He retired, and subsequently purchased Gatcombe Park, an estate in Gloucestershire, and retired to the country. He was appointed High Sheriff of Gloucestershire for 1818\u201319. In August 1818 he bought Lord Portarlington's seat in Parliament for \u00a34,000, as part of the terms of a loan of \u00a325,000. His record in Parliament was that of an earnest reformer. He held the seat until his death five years later.Ricardo was a close friend of James Mill. Other notable friends included Jeremy Bentham and Thomas Malthus, with whom Ricardo had a considerable debate (in correspondence) over such things as the role of landowners in a society. He also was a member of Malthus' Political Economy Club, and a member of the King of Clubs. He was one of the original members of The Geological Society. His youngest sister was author Sarah Ricardo-Porter (e.g., Conversations in Arithmetic). Parliamentary record As MP for Portarlington, Ricardo voted with the opposition in support of liberal political movements in Naples and Sicily, and for inquiry into the administration of justice in Tobago. He divided for (voted for) repeal of the Blasphemous and Seditious Libels Act; then for inquiry into the Peterloo massacre; and, in 1821, for abolition of the death penalty for forgery. He adamantly supported free trade. In 1821 he voted against renewal of the sugar duties, and objected to the higher duty on East Indian as opposed to West Indian produce. He opposed the timber duties. He voted silently for parliamentary reform and in 1822 spoke in its favour at the Westminster anniversary reform dinner; and again voted for criminal law reform. Ricardo believed that increasing imports by free trade boosted the wellbeing of mankind by increasing the amount of goods cheaply available for subsistence and consumption. He was said to have \"possessed an extraordinary quickness in perceiving in the turns of the market any accidental difference which might arise between the relative price of different stocks\". And he grew his wealth dealing in securities during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. As the Napoleonic Wars waged on, Ricardo developed a disdain for the Corn Laws imposed by the British to encourage exports. Notably, government intervention in the grain trade can be traced as far back as the 1400s; and thereafter trade was controlled, regulated, and taxed. Meanwhile, England developed a capitalist economy involving workers and landlords generating and consuming incomes and capital accumulations that depended entirely on capitalists\u2019 profits, and these key economic elements were under perpetual pressure during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Political reform was needed as agricultural output was struggling to keep pace with population growth. The Corn Laws imposed barriers to imports that increased subsistence\/consumption costs and triggered demand for higher wages. Higher wages reduced profits for agricultural producers, and had the immediate effects of reducing capital investments and slowing the growth of a nation's economy. Rising rents, attributed by Ricardo to the Corn Laws, came at the expense of the economic profits of nations. For David Ricardo, free trade was ever the answer; he envisioned Britain as importing agriculture products in exchange for exporting manufactured goods. Eventually, after his death, the interventionist laws were repealed, and his free trade views became public policy in Britain.Of David Ricardo, his friend John Louis Mallett commented: \" \u2026 he meets you upon every subject that he has studied with a mind made up, and opinions in the nature of mathematical truths. He spoke of parliamentary reform and ballot as a man who would bring such things about, and destroy the existing system tomorrow, if it were in his power, and without the slightest doubt on the result \u2026 It is this very quality of the man\u2019s mind, his entire disregard of experience and practice, which makes me doubtful of his opinions on political economy.\" Death and legacy Ten years after retiring and four years after entering Parliament, Ricardo died from an infection of the middle ear that spread into his brain and induced septicaemia. He was 51. He and his wife Priscilla had eight children together including Osman Ricardo (1795\u20131881; MP for Worcester 1847\u20131865), David Ricardo (1803\u20131864, MP for Stroud 1832\u20131833) and Mortimer Ricardo, who served as an officer in the Life Guards and was a deputy lieutenant for Oxfordshire.Ricardo is buried in an ornate grave in the churchyard of Saint Nicholas in Hardenhuish, now a suburb of Chippenham, Wiltshire. At the time of his death his assets were estimated at \u00a3675,000\u2013\u00a3775,000. Ideas He wrote his first economics article at 37, firstly in The Morning Chronicle advocating reduction in the note-issuing of the Bank of England and then publishing The High Price of Bullion, a Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes in 1810.He was also an abolitionist, speaking at a meeting of the Court of the East India Company in March 1823, where he said he regarded slavery as a stain on the character of the nation. Banking Adam Smith argued that free commercial banking, such as the banking system in Scotland which had no central bank when Wealth of Nations was written in 1776, was favorable to economic growth. Writing just a few decades later, Ricardo argued for a central bank, a cause that was taken up by his students, including John Stuart Mill, who was known to favor the laissez-faire policies in every place but banking. Ricardo wrote the Plan for the Establishment of a National Bank (published posthumously in 1824), which argued for the autonomy of the central bank as the issuer of money.Ricardo proposed that a ratio of gold and Treasury bills, and a fixed claim (asset) against the government, would secure the central bank's liquidity: The public, or the Government on behalf of the public, is indebted to the Bank in a sum of money larger than the whole amount of Bank notes in circulation; for the Government not only owes the Bank fifteen million, its original capital, which is lent at 3 per cent. interest, but also many more millions which are advanced on Exchequer bills, on half-pay and pension annuities, and on other securities. It is evident, therefore, that if the Government itself were to be the sole issuer of paper money instead of borrowing it of the Bank, the only difference would be with respect to the interest: the Bank would no longer receive interest and the Government would no longer pay it; but all other classes in the community would be exactly in the same position in which they now stand. Ricardo was a man of many trades, economically and financially speaking. Ricardo was able to recognize and identify the problem presented through banking within regulations and debauched standards of approval at certain times. Ricardo knew that banks in rural areas as well as the Bank of England had increased note lending and overall lending in 1810. Through this, Ricardo proved subsequent changes in price level through the market was also affected and thus new regulations needed to be made available. Furthermore, Ricardo was able to understand and distinguish the socioeconomic makeup that created and established parameters around different classes within the economy. Ricardo advocated for the productive powers of labor to be held in high concern as the most influential of devices that played a role in the progression of the American Economy along with others. In addition, Ricardo made notable advancements in the concept build involving reactions in the open market when considering banking altercations, stock investments, or other considerable impacting events. Ricardo wanted to establish a firm ground between the bank and the control over monetary policy because there was power within the banking system that Ricardo believed needed to be considered carefully. In 1816, Ricardo said \u201cIn the present state of the law, they have the power, without any control whatever, of increasing or reducing the circulation in any degree they may think proper: a power which should neither be entrusted to the State itself, nor to anybody in it; as there can be no security for the uniformity in the value of the currency, when its augmentation or diminution depends solely on the will of the issuers.\u201d Ricardo felt the circulation of money and the decision behind how much is available at any time should not be entrusted to either the State, or any individual. Ricardo argued for the most even distribution possible with the highest control readily available. David Ricardo, The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation Value theory David Ricardo worked to fix the issues he felt were most concerning with Adam Smith\u2019s Labour Theory of Value. Both men worked with the assumption that land, labour, and capital were the three basic factors of production. However, Smith narrowed in on labour as the determinant of value. Ricardo believes that with production having 3 main factors it is impossible for only one of them to determine value on its own. Ricardo illustrates his point by adapting Smith's deer beaver analogy to show that even when labour is the only factor of production the hardship and tools of the labour will drive a wedge in the relative value of the good. Due to his criticisms of the Labour Theory of Value George Stigler called his theory a \"93% labor theory of value\".Ricardo's most famous work is his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817). He advanced a labour theory of value: The value of a commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange, depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production, and not on the greater or less compensation which is paid for that labour. Ricardo's note to Section VI: Mr. Malthus appears to think that it is a part of my doctrine, that the cost and value of a thing be the same;\u2014it is, if he means by cost, \"cost of production\" including profit. Rent Ricardo contributed to the development of theories of rent, wages, and profits. He defined rent as \"the difference between the produce obtained by the employment of two equal quantities of capital and labour.\" Ricardo believed that the process of economic development, which increased land use and eventually led to the cultivation of poorer land, principally benefited landowners. According to Ricardo, such premium over \"real social value\" that is reaped due to ownership constitutes value to an individual but is at best a paper monetary return to \"society\". The portion of such purely individual benefit that accrues to scarce resources Ricardo labels \"rent\". Ricardo's theories of wages and profits In his Theory of Profit, Ricardo stated that as real wages increase, real profits decrease because the revenue from the sale of manufactured goods is split between profits and wages. He said in his Essay on Profits, \"Profits depend on high or low wages, wages on the price of necessaries, and the price of necessaries chiefly on the price of food.\" Ricardian theory of international trade Between 1500 and 1750 most economists advocated Mercantilism, which promoted the idea of international trade for the purpose of earning bullion by running a trade surplus with other countries. Ricardo challenged the idea that the purpose of trade was merely to accumulate gold or silver. With \"comparative advantage\" Ricardo argued in favour of industry specialisation and free trade. He suggested that industry specialization combined with free international trade always produces positive results. This theory expanded on the concept of absolute advantage. Ricardo suggested that there is mutual national benefit from trade even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart and that a nation should concentrate resources only in industries where it has a comparative advantage, that is in those industries in which it has the greatest efficiency of production relative to its own alternative uses of resources, rather than industries where it holds a competitive edge compared to rival nations. Ricardo suggested that national industries which were, in fact, mildly profitable and marginally internationally competitive should be jettisoned in favour of the industries that made the best use of limited resources\u2014the assumption being that subsequent economic growth due to better resource use would more than offset any short-run economic dislocation which would result from closing mildly profitable and marginally competitive national industries. Ricardo attempted to prove theoretically that international trade is always beneficial. Paul Samuelson called the numbers used in Ricardo's example dealing with trade between England and Portugal the \"four magic numbers\". \"In spite of the fact that the Portuguese could produce both cloth and wine with less amount of labour, Ricardo suggested that both countries would benefit from trade with each other\". As for recent extensions of Ricardian models, see Ricardian trade theory extensions. Comparative advantage Ricardo's theory of international trade was reformulated by John Stuart Mill. The term \"comparative advantage\" was started by J. S. Mill and his contemporaries. John Stuart Mill started a neoclassical turn of international trade theory, i.e. his formulation was inherited by Alfred Marshall and others, and has both contributed to the resurrection of the anti-Ricardian concept of law of supply and demand, and induced the arrival of neoclassical theory of value. New interpretation Ricardo's four magic numbers have long been interpreted as comparison of two ratios of labour (or other input in fixed supply) coefficients. This interpretation is now considered as overly simplistic by modern economists. The point was rediscovered by Roy J. Ruffin in 2002 and re-examined and explained in detail in Andrea Maneschi in 2004. The more flexible approach is now known as the new interpretation, despite having been previously mentioned by Piero Sraffa in 1930 and by Kenzo Yukizawa in 1974. The new interpretation affords a totally new reading of Ricardo's Principles of Political Economy and Taxation with regards to trade theory, although it does not change the mathematics of optimal resource allocation. Protectionism Like Adam Smith, Ricardo was an opponent of protectionism for national economies, especially for agriculture. He believed that the British \"Corn Laws\"\u2014imposing tariffs on agricultural products\u2014ensured that less-productive domestic land would be cultivated and rents would be driven up (Case & Fair 1999, pp. 812, 813). Thus, profits would be directed toward landlords and away from the emerging industrial capitalists. Ricardo believed landlords tended to squander their wealth on luxuries, rather than invest. He believed the Corn Laws were leading to the stagnation of the British economy. In 1846, his nephew John Lewis Ricardo, MP for Stoke-upon-Trent, advocated free trade and the repeal of the Corn Laws. Modern empirical analysis of the Corn Laws yields mixed results. Parliament repealed the Corn Laws in 1846. Technological change Ricardo was concerned about the impact of technological change on labour in the short-term. In 1821, he wrote that he had become \"convinced that the substitution of machinery for human labour, is often very injurious to the interests of the class of labourers,\" and that \"the opinion entertained by the labouring class, that the employment of machinery is frequently detrimental to their interests, is not founded on prejudice and error, but is conformable to the correct principles of political economy.\" Ricardo's idea of technological change is now formulated in a modern form. Criticism of the Ricardian theory of trade Ricardo himself was the first to recognize that comparative advantage is a domain-specific theory, meaning that it applies only when certain conditions are met. Ricardo noted that the theory applies only in situations where capital is immobile. Regarding his famous example, he wrote: it would undoubtedly be advantageous to the capitalists [and consumers] of England\u2026 [that] the wine and cloth should both be made in Portugal [and that] the capital and labour of England employed in making cloth should be removed to Portugal for that purpose. Ricardo recognized that applying his theory in situations where capital was mobile would result in offshoring, and thereby economic decline and job loss. To correct for this, he argued that (i) \"most men of property [will be] satisfied with a low rate of profits in their own country, rather than seek[ing] a more advantageous employment for their wealth in foreign nations\", and (ii) capital was functionally immobile.Ricardo's argument in favour of free trade has also been attacked by those who believe trade restriction can be necessary for the economic development of a nation. Utsa Patnaik claims that Ricardian theory of international trade contains a logical fallacy. Ricardo assumed that in both countries two goods are producible and actually are produced, but developed and underdeveloped countries often trade those goods which are not producible in their own country. In these cases, one cannot define which country has comparative advantage.Critics also argue that Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage is flawed in that it assumes production is continuous and absolute. In the real world, events outside the realm of human control (e.g. natural disasters) can disrupt production. In this case, specialisation could cripple a country that depends on imports from foreign, naturally disrupted countries. For example, if an industrially based country trades its manufactured goods with an agrarian country in exchange for agricultural products, a natural disaster in the agricultural country (e.g. drought) may cause the industrially based country to starve. As Joan Robinson pointed out, following the opening of free trade with England, Portugal endured centuries of economic underdevelopment: \"the imposition of free trade on Portugal killed off a promising textile industry and left her with a slow-growing export market for wine, while for England, exports of cotton cloth led to accumulation, mechanisation and the whole spiralling growth of the industrial revolution\". Robinson argued that Ricardo's example required that economies be in static equilibrium positions with full employment and that there could not be a trade deficit or a trade surplus. These conditions, she wrote, were not relevant to the real world. She also argued that Ricardo's math did not take into account that some countries may be at different levels of development and that this raised the prospect of 'unequal exchange' which might hamper a country's development, as we saw in the case of Portugal.The development economist Ha-Joon Chang challenges the argument that free trade benefits every country: Ricardian equivalence Another idea associated with Ricardo is Ricardian equivalence, an argument suggesting that in some circumstances a government's choice of how to pay for its spending (i.e., whether to use tax revenue or issue debt and run a deficit) might have no effect on the economy. This is due to the fact the public saves its excess money to pay for expected future tax increases that will be used to pay off the debt. Ricardo notes that the proposition is theoretically implied in the presence of intertemporal optimisation by rational tax-payers: but that since tax-payers do not act so rationally, the proposition fails to be true in practice. Thus, while the proposition bears his name, he does not seem to have believed it. Economist Robert Barro is responsible for its modern prominence. Influence and intellectual legacy David Ricardo's ideas had a tremendous influence on later developments in economics. US economists rank Ricardo as the second most influential economic thinker, behind Adam Smith, prior to the twentieth century. Ricardian socialists Ricardo's writings fascinated a number of early socialists in the 1820s, who thought his value theory had radical implications. They argued that, in view of labour theory of value, labour produces the entire product, and the profits capitalists get are a result of exploitations of workers. These include Thomas Hodgskin, William Thompson, John Francis Bray, and Percy Ravenstone. Georgists Georgists believe that rent, in the sense that Ricardo used, belongs to the community as a whole. Henry George was greatly influenced by Ricardo, and often cited him, including in his most famous work, Progress and Poverty from 1879. In the preface to the fourth edition he wrote: \"What I have done in this book, if I have correctly solved the great problem I have sought to investigate, is, to unite the truth perceived by the school of Smith and Ricardo to the truth perceived by the school of Proudhon and Lasalle; to show that laissez faire (in its full true meaning) opens the way to a realization of the noble dreams of socialism; to identify social law with moral law, and to disprove ideas which in the minds of many cloud grand and elevating perceptions.\" Neo-Ricardians After the rise of the 'neoclassical' school, Ricardo's influence declined temporarily. It was Piero Sraffa, the editor of the Collected Works of David Ricardo and the author of seminal Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities, who resurrected Ricardo as the originator of another strand of economic thought, which was effaced with the arrival of the neoclassical school. The new interpretation of Ricardo and Sraffa's criticism against the marginal theory of value gave rise to a new school, now named neo-Ricardian or Sraffian school. Major contributors to this school include Luigi Pasinetti (1930\u2013), Pierangelo Garegnani (1930\u20132011), Ian Steedman (1941\u2013), Geoffrey Harcourt (1931\u20132021), Heinz Kurz (1946\u2013), Neri Salvadori (1951\u2013), Pier Paolo Saviotti (\u2013) among others. See also Neo-Ricardianism. The Neo-Ricardian school is sometimes seen to be a component of Post-Keynesian economics. Neo-Ricardian trade theory Inspired by Piero Sraffa, a new strand of trade theory emerged and was named neo-Ricardian trade theory. The main contributors include Ian Steedman and Stanley Metcalfe. They have criticised neoclassical international trade theory, namely the Heckscher\u2013Ohlin model on the basis that the notion of capital as primary factor has no method of measuring it before the determination of profit rate (thus trapped in a logical vicious circle). This was a second round of the Cambridge capital controversy, this time in the field of international trade. Depoort\u00e8re and Ravix judge that neo-Ricardian contribution failed without giving effective impact on neoclassical trade theory, because it could not offer \"a genuine alternative approach from a classical point of view.\" Evolutionary growth theory Several distinctive groups have sprung out of the neo-Ricardian school. One is the evolutionary growth theory, developed notably by Luigi Pasinetti, J.S. Metcalfe, Pier Paolo Saviotti, and Koen Frenken and others.Pasinetti argued that the demand for any commodity came to stagnate and frequently decline, demand saturation occurs. Introduction of new commodities (goods and services) is necessary to avoid economic stagnation. Contemporary theories Ricardo's idea was even expanded to the case of continuum of goods by Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson This formulation is employed for example by Matsuyama and others. Ricardian trade theory ordinarily assumes that the labour is the unique input. This is a deficiency as intermediate goods occupies now a great part of international trade. The situation changed after the appearance of Yoshinori Shiozawa's work of 2007. He has succeeded to incorporate traded input goods in his model. His theory became more useful by the discovery of new definition of regular international values (a couple of wage rates for countries and prices for products), because it is not defined as the normal vector at a facet of world production possibility set, which is the set where all countries enjoy full employment. The new definition is given in Shiozawa and Fujimoto (2018) and in Shiozawa (2020). Shiozawa's theory of international values is now the unique theory of international trade that can treat unemployment and input trade in a general form. Yeats found that 30% of world trade in manufacturing is intermediate inputs. Bardhan and Jafee found that intermediate inputs occupy 37 to 38% in the imports to the US for the years from 1992 to 1997, whereas the percentage of intrafirm trade grew from 43% in 1992 to 52% in 1997. Unequal exchange Chris Edward includes Emmanuel's unequal exchange theory among variations of neo-Ricardian trade theory. Arghiri Emmanuel argued that the Third World is poor because of the international exploitation of labour.The unequal exchange theory of trade has been influential to the (new) dependency theory. Publications Ricardo's publications included: The High Price of Bullion, a Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes (1810), which advocated the adoption of a metallic currency. Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock (1815), which argued that repealing the Corn Laws would distribute more wealth to the productive members of society. On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817), an analysis that concluded that land rent grows as population increases. It also clearly laid out the theory of comparative advantage, which argued that all nations could benefit from free trade, even if a nation was less efficient at producing all kinds of goods than its trading partners.His works and writings were collected in Ricardo, David (1981).

He made his senior debut on 12 January 2014, starting for the B team in a 2\u20130 home win against Portimonense in the Segunda Liga. He scored his first goals in the competition on 22 March, helping to a 2\u20132 away draw with Feirense.Paci\u00eancia first appeared in competitive games with the main squad on 21 January 2015, again acting as starter in a 1\u20131 draw at Braga in the Ta\u00e7a da Liga. He netted his first goal in the same competition, in a 4\u20131 home victory over Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra that took place the following week.On 29 July 2015, Paci\u00eancia joined Acad\u00e9mica in a season-long loan. On 31 August 2016, still owned by Porto, he moved to Olympiacos. His spell at the latter club, which was undermined by heart problems, was concluded in December.Paci\u00eancia continued to be loaned the following seasons, to Rio Ave and Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal. On 25 August 2017, while at the service of the latter club, he scored an own goal in an eventual 1\u20131 away draw against Belenenses, coached by his father. On 27 January 2018, he netted early in the final of the League Cup and also converted his penalty shootout attempt, in a loss to Sporting CP after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation time. Eintracht Frankfurt On 12 July 2018, deemed surplus to requirements as practically all Portuguese players by manager S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Paci\u00eancia signed a four-year contract with German club Eintracht Frankfurt. He made his debut on 18 August in the first round of the DFB-Pokal, in which he came on as a late substitute and scored a consolation in a 2\u20131 defeat for the holders at Regionalliga team SSV Ulm, but a month later he suffered a knee injury in training. He returned for his Bundesliga debut the following 17 February, as a last-minute replacement for S\u00e9bastien Haller in a 1\u20131 home draw with Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach; he finished the season with three goals, beginning with the added-time winner against Hoffenheim at the Waldstadion on his first start.Paci\u00eancia scored seven league goals in 2019\u201320 campaign for the ninth-placed side (ten in all competitions), including two on 18 October in a 3\u20130 home win over Bayer Leverkusen. He played regularly under manager Adi H\u00fctter alongside compatriot Andr\u00e9 Silva and Dutchman Bas Dost, making up for the sales of Haller, Luka Jovi\u0107 and Ante Rebi\u0107; on 25 January he signed a new contract until 2023.On 15 September 2020, Paci\u00eancia joined Schalke 04 on a year-long loan with an option to make the move permanent. His maiden league appearance took place three days later, when he started in the 8\u20130 away loss to Bayern Munich; on 18 October he scored his only goal for the eventually relegated team to gain a home draw against Union Berlin, their first point in the eighth game of the season. From November to April, he was sidelined with another knee injury.Paci\u00eancia scored twice in Eintracht's run to the 2022 UEFA Europa League Final, earning a win and a draw against Royal Antwerp. He was unused for the decisive match at the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n Stadium, a penalty shootout defeat of Rangers. Celta On 6 August 2022, Paci\u00eancia moved to Spain after agreeing to a three-year deal at Celta. He scored on his La Liga debut a week later, in a 2\u20132 home draw with Espanyol. He did not hold down a regular place in the team during his first season, particularly after the arrival of compatriot Carlos Carvalhal as manager, and his minutes dried up further after the signing of Haris Seferovic in January. International career Paci\u00eancia earned 57 caps for Portugal at youth level, scoring 21 goals. His first game for the under-21 team was on 5 March 2014 at the age of 19, when he started and missed a second-half penalty in a 2\u20130 home win over North Macedonia in the 2015 UEFA European Championship qualifiers. Selected for the finals in the Czech Republic, he collected three substitute appearances for the runners-up, scoring in the 1\u20131 group stage draw with Sweden and converting his shootout attempt in the final against the same opponent.Paci\u00eancia was part of the squad at the 2016 Summer Olympics, netting three times in the group phase in an eventual quarter-final exit. He first appeared with the full side on 14 November 2017, coming on as a 46th-minute substitute for Gelson Martins in a 1\u20131 friendly draw against the United States. In his second match, exactly two years later, he played the entire 6\u20130 rout of Lithuania in the Algarve in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying stage, scoring the fourth goal. Personal life Paci\u00eancia's father, Domingos, was also a footballer and a forward. He too was groomed at Porto.

He was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain and general secretary of the Young Communist League.\n\n  Biography Ashton was born in Oldham, and moved to Portrush, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, where he grew up. He studied at the former Northern Ireland Hotel and Catering College in Portrush, before moving to London in 1978. Richard Coles wrote about this period: \"Mark also worked for a while as a barman at the Conservative Club in King\u2019s Cross, or, rather, as a barmaid, in drag, with a blonde beehive wig. I was never sure if the patrons worked out that he was really a man\".In 1982 he spent three months in Bangladesh visiting his parents, where his father was working for the textile machinery industry. The experience of his sojourn had a profound effect on him. Upon his return, he volunteered with the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard, supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and joined the Young Communist League. In 1983 he featured in the Lesbian and Gay Youth Video Project film Framed Youth: The Revenge of the Teenage Perverts, an early documentary that won the Grierson Award 1984 for Best Documentary.He formed, with his friend Mike Jackson, the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM) support group after the two men collected donations for the miners on strike at the 1984 Lesbian and Gay Pride march in London. The group was formed in Ashton's flat in Claydon House on the Heygate Estate, Elephant and Castle.After LGSM, he became involved in the Red Wedge collective and became the General Secretary of the Young Communist League from 1985 to 1986.Diagnosed with HIV\/AIDS, Ashton was admitted to Guy's Hospital on 30 January 1987 and died 12 days later of Pneumocystis pneumonia. His death prompted a significant response from the gay community, particularly in publication and attendance at his funeral at Lambeth Cemetery. Legacy In his memory, the Mark Ashton Trust was created to raise money for individuals living with HIV, and as of 2007 it had raised \u00a320,000. Since 2008, the Terrence Higgins Trust has included the Mark Ashton Red Ribbon Fund, which had collected more than \u00a338,000 as of 2017. Mark Ashton is also remembered on a panel on the UK AIDS Memorial Quilt and has been memorialised in May 2014 on a plaque at the entrance to the London headquarters of the Terrence Higgins Trust.In 2017, on what would have been Ashton's 57th birthday, a blue plaque was unveiled in his honour above the Gay's The Word bookshop in Marchmont Street, London, the site where LGSM met and held meetings during the miners' strike.The ballad \"For a Friend\" in the album Red from synth-pop duo The Communards was written in his memory. Mark Hooper of The Rough Guide to Rock writes that this cut may be Somerville's \"most impassioned moment\". Ashton was a friend of both Jimmy Somerville and Richard Coles. For a Friend reached number 28 on the British charts.The Constantine Giannaris film Jean Genet Is Dead (1989) is dedicated to his memory.The LGSM's activities were dramatised in Pride, a film released in September 2014 featuring Ben Schnetzer as Ashton. Ashton's role in the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners group was recalled in a series of interviews with some of its other members prior to the film's release. However, Ashton's membership in the Young Communist League was not explicitly mentioned in the film, possibly to avoid alienating American audiences. Fellow communist activist and a close friend of Mark Ashton, Lorraine Douglas, accused the film of having \"glossed over Mark's politics and said nothing about the fact he subsequently became General Secretary of the YCL\", the youth wing of the Communist Party of Great Britain.Schnetzer, an American actor, was nominated for two British Independent Film Awards for his performance.On 25 September 2018, the Council of Paris awarded the garden adjoining the H\u00f4tel d'Angoul\u00eame Lamoignon the new name of Jardin de l'H\u00f4tel-Lamoignon - Mark-Ashton (H\u00f4tel-Lamoignon - Mark Ashton Garden), in his memory.On 2 June 2021, the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council approved the erection of a memorial blue plaque in his hometown of Portrush.On 28 August 2022, a tree was planted in St Columbs park in memory of Mark Ashton, as part of the 2022 Foyle pride events. His former LGSM member Mike Jackson and civil rights activist Bernadette McAliskey were in attendance.

Early years Born in Evesham, Worcestershire, Lanchbury attended Cheltenham Grammar School, where he played in the First XI. After leaving school, he made a number of appearances for Gloucestershire's Second XI between 1969 and 1971. At the end of July 1971, he was called into the first team to open the batting in the County Championship match at Worcester, but although Gloucestershire won by an innings, bowling out their opponents for 58 and 88, Lanchbury failed personally, being bowled for a duck by Vanburn Holder. Despite this failure, he kept his place in the side for the next few matches, but his highest score from eight further first-class innings (and a solitary appearance in the John Player League) was the 38 he hit in the return encounter against Worcestershire at Cheltenham, and later in August a run of four successive dismissals for single-figure scores saw him dropped. He left the county at the end of the season and made the short trip to join Worcestershire. Sitting out 1972 was a frustrating season for Lanchbury as he made no first-team appearances, having to wait until the New Zealanders' visit to New Road in late April 1973 to make his senior debut for his new county. Play was possible on only two of the scheduled three days and the game was drawn, but Lanchbury made a handy 46 in the Worcestershire middle order. He ended up playing in another four first-class games that summer, as well as making two nondescript appearances at List A level. However, by the end of the year he was firmly back in the seconds, for whom he hit 132 not out against Glamorgan II in late August. The 1974 season held few highlights for Lanchbury, other than his solitary first-class half-century: 50* against Oxford University early in the season. At this point he was scoring consistently for the second team, and in mid-June he was recalled to County Championship action against Warwickshire, scoring 29 and 27 before being dismissed in each innings by Eddie Hemmings. He played a couple more first-team matches with little success, but he did make 97 in a minor match against the Canadians in July. That was the end of his county career, and in 1975 Lanchbury played in the Lancashire League as Lowerhouse's professional. Through the late 1970s and 1980s he also played a number of minor games for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Ireland and Scotland, but in 1984 he joined Wiltshire, and played for them until 1988. He played twice for them at List A level in the NatWest Trophy, as well as representing the Minor Counties representative side in two Benson & Hedges Cup games. He also made one final first-class appearance, for Minor Counties against the Zimbabweans at Cleethorpes in 1985; in this game he bowled the only two overs of his first-class career.

He has had a long-running partnership with Seth MacFarlane, composing music for his films and TV shows such as Family Guy, The Cleveland Show, American Dad!, Ted, and Ted 2.\n\n  Early life Murphy was born on December 19, 1952, in New York City, and grew up in Manhattan. At age four, he attended music lessons hosted by Rosa Rio, studying an array of instruments, including the organ and piano. Rio frequently opted for him to star in television advertisements for the Hammond organ. In high school, Murphy composed for his band class and orchestra.Against the wishes of his father, who was a real estate agent and wished to pass the business down to his son, Murphy enrolled in the Manhattan School of Music under a composition major in 1970. recalling his experiences with his father, Murphy stated \"He wanted me to be a doctor or lawyer\u2014or something you can depend on.\" There, Murphy studied jazz and classical piano with Nicolas Flagello and Ludmila Ulehla. His postgraduate studies at the Manhattan School yielded the composition \"Chorale and Allegro for Orchestra\", which has been performed by orchestras throughout the United States. Career 1970\u20131976: Early years From 1970 to 1980, Murphy worked as a Manhattan Avenue jingle writer, writing for such clients as Lady Arrow shirts, Revlon, Woolworth's, Viasa Airlines, and Korvette's, as well as arrangements for the popular children's television series Big Blue Marble.In the early 1970s, Murphy was the leader of the soul\/R&B cover band WAM. They gigged in the New York tri-state area, often at the New Rochelle club Pearly's. During an appointment with Bobby Rosengarden, bandleader of the Dick Cavett Show orchestra, Murphy convinced the group to play some of his arrangements when he found Rosengarden to be absent. Looking back on the situation, he stated \"I still can't believe I did it. I'm not a very forward person.\" Since the band \"wasn't very busy,\" they performed his arrangements live and enjoyed them, convincing Murphy to write more.In April 1972, a fellow student from the Manhattan School of Music introduced Murphy to Doc Severinsen, musical director of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Murphy presented his arrangements to Severinsen, who liked them enough to have The Tonight Show Band play them live. However, The Tonight Show moved production to Burbank, California a month later, and a final year of college prevented Murphy from joining them.In 1974, Murphy joined Thomas J. Valentino's company Valentino, Inc., composing much of their library music for film and television over the years. In 1976, Murphy played piano on Peter Lemongello's second album Do I Love You. 1976\u20131979: Private Stock years, breakthrough In college, Murphy's interests had included rock music, particularly that which was adapted from classical music, such as \"Joy\" by Apollo 100 and \"A Lover's Concerto\" by The Toys. Later, in 1976, he was writing a disco song for a commercial, when a producer gave him the idea of \"updating classical music,\" which \"nobody had done lately.\" He then recorded a demo tape of four songs\u2014three were ordinary pop songs, while the fourth was a disco rendition of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony titled \"A Fifth of Beethoven\"\u2014and mailed it to various record labels in New York City. Response was generally unimpressive, but \"Fifth\" caught the interest of Private Stock Records owner Larry Uttal. Murphy signed on to Private Stock and recorded the album A Fifth of Beethoven. The first single and title track, \"A Fifth of Beethoven\", was released on May 29, 1976. It was a hit, starting out at number 80 on the Billboard Hot 100 and eventually reaching number 1 within 19 weeks, where it stayed for one week. The single sold two million copies, while the album sold about 750,000 copies. The second single, a rendition of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" titled \"Flight '76\", was less successful, reaching only number 44 on the Hot 100.The single was initially credited to \"Walter Murphy & The Big Apple Band\" upon encouragement from Private Stock, who believed it would become a hit if credited to a group rather than an individual. However, two days following the record's release, Private Stock discovered the existence of another Big Apple Band (which promptly changed its name to Chic). As result, the record was later re-released and credited to \"The Walter Murphy Band\", then just \"Walter Murphy\".Following the success of \"A Fifth of Beethoven\", Murphy toured with his band and made guest appearances on shows such as Don Kirshner's Rock Concert, The Midnight Special, Dinah!, and American Bandstand. On the success of the single, he said: \"It's really sad that the kids today can only relate to Beethoven via a rock version of his music.\" He hoped \"that maybe if they've heard this much of his symphony, they'll go out and buy the original.\"In 1977, \"A Fifth of Beethoven\" was licensed to RSO Records for inclusion on the soundtrack to the film Saturday Night Fever, giving the song a new lease on life. Also that year, Murphy recorded the album Rhapsody in Blue, which contained a similar mix of classical-disco fusion and self-penned pop songs. Two singles were released: a disco treatment of George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\", and the self-penned instrumental \"Uptown Serenade.\" The former narrowly missed the top 100, but received significant play on easy-listening stations, according to Billboard. In 1978, Murphy recorded the album Phantom of the Opera, a concept album telling the story of The Phantom of the Opera, featuring Gene Pistilli as Erik\/The Phantom, B.G. Gibson as Raoul, and Ren\u00e9e Geyer as Christine. The album spawned three singles: \"Dance Your Face Off\"\/\"Gentle Explosion\" (a double A-side), \"Toccata and Funk in 'D' Minor\", and \"The Music Will Not End\". The latter was a Top 40 hit, but the former failed to make the club or radio charts. 1979\u20131982: RCA and MCA years, Uncle Louie Murphy signed on to RCA in 1979, and released the album Walter Murphy's Discosymphony. The album spawned the singles \"Bolero\" and \"Mostly Mozart\"; the latter failed to chart, indicating that Murphy had taken the \"classical disco\" concept as far as it could go. Also in 1979, Murphy and Gene Pistilli joined with brothers Eddie and Frank Dillard, forming the band Uncle Louie. They signed on to TK Records and released one album, Uncle Louie's Here, which explored a more aggressive, funk-based angle than Murphy's solo albums. The album spawned three singles: \"Full-Tilt Boogie\", which reached number 19 on the Billboard R&B chart, \"I Like Funky Music\", and \"Sky High\". Around this time, Murphy and Pistilli wrote and\/or produced songs for other artists, including \"Something to Hold Onto\" (1981) by Harry Belafonte and \"What's Wrong With This Picture?\" (1980) by Lora Lee Cliff. Murphy also contributed arrangements to Jack Jones's Nobody Does It Better (1979) and Pia Zadora's Rock It Out (1984). In 1982, Murphy signed on to MCA Records and recorded Themes from E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and More. The album contained disco- and pop-tinged arrangements of themes to popular movies of the time, such as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Indiana Jones, and Poltergeist. The album spawned one single, a medley of \"Themes from ET (The Extra-Terrestrial)\", which climbed to number 47 on the Billboard Hot 100. 1982\u20131999: Move to behind-the-scenes roles Following Themes from E.T., Murphy largely ceased touring and recording studio albums of original material. He instead began focusing more exclusively on composing for film and television, and producing for other artists, in a more behind-the-scenes role. Artists that Murphy has recorded and\/or produced for include Dolly Parton, Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Warnes, Siedah Garrett, Tim Schmitt, Richie Havens, Isaac Hayes, Taj Mahal, Paul Williams, and Kenny Rankin. He was also a guest conductor for the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, during their successful Summer Pops series.In 1984, Murphy and television composer Mike Post co-produced Alabama's \"Rock on the Bayou\", the B-side to the band's hit single \"(There's A) Fire in the Night\". \"Rock on the Bayou\" was featured in the independent film The River Rat, which Post also composed the music for. In 1985, Murphy collaborated with Post, Rick James, and Issac Hayes on scoring music for The A-Team episode \"The Heart of Rock 'N Roll\". 1999\u2013present: Collaborations with Seth MacFarlane Since 1999, Murphy has served as one of the two main composers for the animated series Family Guy, the other being Ron Jones until the 12th season in 2014. He has described his scores for Family Guy as \"a combination of [big-band swing and action-orchestral].\" The song \"You've Got a Lot to See\", composed for the episode \"Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows\", won the award for Outstanding Music and Lyrics at the 2002 Emmy Awards. In 2005, Murphy scored music for the offshoot album Family Guy: Live in Vegas.Since 2005, Murphy is one of the composers for MacFarlane's American Dad!, the other two being Joel McNeely and Ron Jones, as well as composing the series' theme song \"Good Morning USA\".From 2009 to 2013, Murphy composed music for MacFarlane's series The Cleveland Show, including the main title theme.In 2012, Murphy scored MacFarlane's film Ted, and received an Academy Award for Best Original Song nomination for co-writing \"Everybody Needs a Best Friend\" with MacFarlane. Murphy is also a longtime collaborator with jazz guitarist Thom Rotella, who had played on Murphy's albums A Fifth of Beethoven and Phantom of the Opera and currently performs with his Family Guy orchestra. In 1989, Murphy arranged the song \"The Gift\" on Rotella's album Home Again. In 2014, Murphy and Rotella wrote and recorded a four-track big band project, inspired by the Wes Montgomery and Verve-era Oliver Nelson records of the 1960s that the two of them had grown up on. The project was recorded in Capitol Studio A with engineer Al Schmitt, and performed by renown Los Angeles session musicians.

Early life Novo was born in Ferrol, Galicia. His father, Ricardo G\u00f3mez Varela, was a centre half known as Richard who spent one year at Real Betis. Club career Raith Rovers Novo joined Raith Rovers from SD Huesca in July 2001. He made a scoring debut against Airdrieonians on 4 August, and netted the winner during a Challenge Cup match against Alloa Athletic three days later. Novo saw himself sent off in only his third match for Raith, whilst playing against Partick Thistle. Despite this setback he went on to score consistently in the Scottish First Division, netting doubles against St Mirren and twice against Falkirk. Novo accumulated a total of 22 goals in 38 appearances during his first season in Scotland. Dundee His goal scoring record attracted the attention of Scottish Premier League club Dundee who signed him for \u00a3100,000 in July 2002. He made his Scottish Premier League debut on 3 August 2002 in a 1\u20131 draw with Hearts. Novo scored his first and second goals for the club against Dunfermline Athletic on 17 August but was sent-off in the dying moments of the match for raising his foot at Pars defender Scott Wilson. He went on to score a further seven goals to end the season with a tally of nine. His second season saw Novo return to form, scoring four goals in the UEFA Cup, including one against then Serie A outfit Perugia, helped him to an end of season tally of 25. This form attracted the interest of several clubs including Celtic and Rangers. Celtic had a \u00a3500,000 bid accepted but failed to agree terms the player, stating Novo didn't have the \"necessary level of commitment\" during signing talks. Rangers Novo signed for Rangers on 6 July 2004 for a reported fee of \u00a3450,000. He was allocated the number 10 shirt that had been vacated by Michael Mols. In his first season at the club he scored 25 goals, including the goal against Hibernian that won Rangers the league title. He made his debut for Rangers in a Scottish Premier League match away to Aberdeen on 7 August 2004. His first goal came in his second appearance, netting in Rangers' 2\u20131 loss to Russian side CSKA Moscow on 10 August.Following his first goal, Novo failed to score in his next eight appearances and he was dropped from the starting eleven. He came on as a 66th-minute substitute in a league match against his former employers Dundee. Novo netted two goals in as many minutes which helped Rangers to a 2\u20130 victory, after which he was a regular in the side. At the start of the 2005\u201306 season, Novo broke his fifth metatarsal, which ruled him out for several months. Upon his return from injury he failed to score in the twenty matches he played the rest of that season, being deployed more as a winger than a striker due to the form of Kris Boyd. His three goals had come against Celtic, Falkirk and Cypriot club Anorthosis Famagusta. With the departure of Alex McLeish and the arrival of Frenchman Paul Le Guen, Novo looked set to leave Rangers. However, a proposed transfer to English First Division club Coventry City fell through on transfer deadline day. Novo initially found his appearances sporadic, featuring in the first game of the season then waiting seven weeks for his second but after a mixture of poor results, injuries and his good performances for the reserves Novo returned to the first team. His first goal of that season, and in over a year, was during a 3\u20132 UEFA Cup win over Livorno on 19 October 2006. The following match, Novo came off the bench to score a late winner against St Mirren in a 3\u20132 win. He then started the next game, Motherwell held Rangers to a 1\u20131 draw with Novo named Man of the Match. His rejuvenated form continued with goals against Heart of Midlothian, Maccabi Haifa and AJ Auxerre. Novo continued to be a regular when Le Guen was replaced with Walter Smith. The signings of strikers in the summer of 2007 led to increased competition for attacking positions and most of Novo's appearances in the early months of the season were as a substitute. On 20 October, he started the first Old Firm derby match of the season and scored twice in a 3\u20130 victory for Rangers over Celtic. On 2 December 2007, it was reported that Rangers were willing to offer Novo a one-year extension to his current contract, which was to expire in July 2008. However, Novo said that he would leave the club if he was not offered a longer contract. He was later offered a two-year contract extension until the summer of 2010, and signed the deal on 21 December 2007.On 1 May 2008, he scored the winning penalty in the semi final shoot-out against Fiorentina which put Rangers through to the 2008 UEFA Cup Final. During the 2007\u201308 season Novo was sent off twice, both in league games before cup finals, meaning that he missed both the 2008 League Cup final and the 2008 Scottish Cup final through suspension. The 2008\u201309 season saw Novo used almost exclusively as a substitute. He came off the bench in the 2009 Scottish Cup Final to score the winning goal after only being on the field for 28 seconds.During what turned out to be his final season with Rangers, he won both the league and Scottish League Cup, scoring nine times, but was mainly used as a substitute, starting just 14 league games. Novo decided not to sign a new contract as he was not getting enough starting opportunities.On 30 March 2014 Novo was inducted into the Rangers Hall of Fame along with Fernando Ricksen and Lee McCulloch Sporting de Gij\u00f3n In May 2010, Novo moved to La Liga side Sporting de Gij\u00f3n, on a two-year deal. After a difficult first season in Spain, Novo was offered to clubs in the summer of 2011 with a return to Scotland being mooted. Aberdeen boss Craig Brown said that he had turned down the chance to sign Novo, but this was later denied by the player's agent.Sporting boss Javier Clemente, branded Novo \"a coward\", and of \"showing no commitment to the club in their time of need\", and tore up Novo's contract. Clemente then states he \u201cWent into the dressing room and told the rest of the players that if we had any other cowards they could also leave.\u201d Legia Warsaw and Huesca On 16 February 2012, Novo signed a 6-month contract with Legia Warsaw. He made his debut on 26 February against \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw and was substituted in the 59th minute with his side leading 3\u20130, Legia eventually winning 4\u20130. Novo made 11 League and 3 Cup appearances for Legia, scoring once in a 2\u20131 win over Arka Gdynia in the semi-final of the Polish Cup.In July 2012 Novo returned to Spain to rejoin Second division side Huesca with whom he spent a successful 2-year spell between 1999 and 2001. Novo's second spell at the club was less successful than his first, scoring only 6 league goals. In November 2012, Novo was sent off after scoring in a 2\u20131 win over Guadalajara for gestures made towards the crowd. Novo protested his innocence, stating that the 'gestures' were in fact a \"dedication\" towards his late mother. Huesca ended being relegated at the end of the season, and Novo became a free agent. Later career Novo signed a short-term contract with Scottish Championship club Greenock Morton in October 2013, in a deal that was scheduled to run until 12 January 2014. However, after a disappointing return of only one goal, and with Morton at the bottom of the Championship, Novo was released from his contract ahead of schedule on 24 December.On 11 February 2014, Novo signed a short-term deal until the end of the 2013\u201314 season with Football League One side Carlisle United. He was released in May following their relegation, after appearing in only six matches.On 11 September 2014, Novo signed for Carolina RailHawks of USL Pro.On 26 July 2016, it was announced Novo would join Northern Ireland Football League team Glentoran. A few weeks after his arrival in Belfast, Novo was warned by police that he was under a death threat from dissident republicans. The latter part of his season was marred by a six-game ban for a headbutt against Crusaders in January. After scoring a total of 4 goals in 28 games, he was released in May 2017.After leaving Glentoran, it was reported that Novo hoped to move into a coaching role, however by the end of 2017 Novo had instead announced plans to open a Rangers-themed bar in Glasgow. International career Novo was never selected for the Spain national team but has played for Galicia \u2013 his debut was in a 2008 friendly against Iran, arriving in his homeland just an hour before the match started after playing for Rangers against Celtic earlier in the day. He scored two goals and left to the acclaim of the Galician fans. On 24 October 2008, it was reported that Novo could be selected by the Scottish national team as he was eligible to acquire a British passport, having lived in Scotland for eight years. This led to much debate amongst the Scottish media as to whether Novo, who was born in Spain and has no Scottish parents or grandparents, should be selected by Scotland. It eventually became clear, however, that the Home Nations would continue to honour a deal whereby that any player selected by England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales would be required to have a blood tie to that country, or have had five years compulsory education within it. This deal would rule out the prospect of Novo playing for Scotland. Coaching On 15 November 2022, Novo was named as an assistant coach for USL League One club Lexington SC, where he will also serve as the head coach of the club's U-23 team. The move reunites Novo with Sam Stockley, who was Novo's teammate at Carolina Railhawks. Personal life Novo met Donna Clark in 2004 when playing in Scotland, and the couple were engaged a year later. During a lengthy engagement, they had a son together, Javier, before finally marrying in February 2015 where Novo's ex-Rangers team-mate, Marvin Andrews, acted as pastor. He resides in Scotland.In January 2018, 38-year-old Novo suffered a heart attack while playing for a team of Rangers legends at the AOK Masters in Berlin. He was immediately rushed to hospital and underwent emergency surgery.

E. Taylor, was a British idealist philosopher most famous for his contributions to the philosophy of idealism in his writings on metaphysics, the philosophy of religion, moral philosophy, and the scholarship of Plato. He was a fellow of the British Academy (1911) and president of the Aristotelian Society from 1928 to 1929. At Oxford he was made an honorary fellow of New College in 1931. In an age of universal upheaval and strife, he was a notable defender of Idealism in the Anglo-Saxon world.  Career Taylor was both a philosopher in his own right, addressing all the central problems of philosophy, and a philosophical scholar. Educated at Oxford in the closing days of the great European idealist movement, Taylor was early influenced by the school of British idealism, especially neo-Hegelianism. He was educated at New College, where he obtained a First in Literae Humaniores or 'Greats' in 1891 and held a prize fellowship at Merton College (1891\u201396); he was re-elected as a Fellow in 1902. His first major book, Elements of Metaphysics (1903), dedicated (in heartfelt acknowledgment) to F. H. Bradley, is a systematic treatise of metaphysics covering such topics as ontology, cosmology, and rational psychology, and influenced by scholars including Josiah Royce, James Ward, George Frederick Stout, Richard Avenarius, and Hugo Munsterberg, as well as Robert Adamson, Wilhelm Ostwald, Bertrand Russell, and even Louis Couturat.In later years, most notably in The Faith of a Moralist, Taylor began to move away from certain doctrines of his early idealistic youth, towards a more mature and comprehensive idealist philosophy. While students at Oxford and Cambridge were in thrall of anti-idealism, Taylor for many years influenced generations of young people at the University of St. Andrews (1908\u20131924) and the University of Edinburgh (1924\u20131941), two of the most ancient and prestigious universities of the United Kingdom, where he was Professor of Moral Philosophy. As a philosophical scholar he is considered, alongside Francis Macdonald Cornford, one of the greatest English Platonists of his time. In the first half of the 20th century, Taylor remained, in a reactionary age of anti-metaphysics and growing political irrationalism, a lonely but stalwart defender of 19th century European philosophical idealism in the English-speaking world.But his scholarship was not confined to Greek philosophy. In 1938 Taylor published in Philosophy, 13, 406\u201324, a landmark article, \"The Ethical Doctrine of Hobbes\". This argues that 'Hobbes's ethical theory is logically independent of the egoistic psychology and is a strict deontology' (Stuart Brown, 'The Taylor Thesis', Hobbes Studies, ed. K. Thomas, Oxford: Blackwell, 1965: 31). (The text of Taylor's article is reprinted in the same volume.) The deontological angle was developed, though with divergencies from Taylor's argument, by Howard Warrender in The Political Philosophy of Hobbes, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1957. Major contributions As a scholar of Plato, he is perhaps most famous for presenting evidence in support of the position the vast majority of the statements of Socrates in the Platonic dialogues accurately depict ideas of the historical man himself. His magnum opus, Plato: The Man and His Work (1926) and his commentary on the Timaeus (1927) are particularly important contributions to the higher learning of his time. In moral philosophy he explored such issues as free will and the relationship between rightness and goodness. Taylor was greatly influenced by the thought of classical antiquity, by such philosophers as Plato and Aristotle, as well as medieval scholasticism.His contribution to the philosophy of religion is mainly his 1926\u201328 Gifford Lectures, \"The Faith of a Moralist\" (1930). Taylor made many contributions to the philosophical journal, Mind. He wrote some of the major articles in James Hastings' Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics.

He played in the films Private Ivan, Ivan Brovkin on the State Farm and Street Full of Surprises. Honored Artist of the RSFSR (1972).  Life He was born in Leningrad on 19 May 1930, and died in Moscow on 20 June 1987, aged 57. Career Training In early life he was ambivalent about an acting career. Although he took part in amateur productions, and in the ninth grade applied to theatre school, he nevertheless chose to study law for a year at university, while continuing theatrical performance in his spare time. \"In the play The Inspector, he rocked the entire city of Leningrad; he played Bobchinsky and it was after this role that he again seriously considered an acting career.\" That summer, the Moscow Art School toured in Leningrad and offered auditions at his school. Kharitonov secretly attended, and was accepted. Overview of acting career He graduated from the Nemirovich-Danchenko studio school at the Moscow Art Theatre in 1954. This was the Gorky Art Academic Theatre. After graduating from the studio school he continued working as an actor at the same theatre. He was an actor with the Academic Art Theatre in the name of M. Gorky, or Gorky Theatre, from 1954 to 1962, but then he left this theatre and in 1962\u20131963 he performed with the Theatre of Lenin Komsomol and with the Pushkin Theatre. But in 1963 he returned to the Gorky Art Academic Theatre. He was a film actor from 1954: his first role was Boris Gorikov in the movie School of Courage, while he was still an acting student. Early career and characterisations In 1955, Kharitonov became a public idol after Private Ivan was screened throughout the country. He was the object of much fan mail, and appeared privately to many local audiences in clubs, schools, factories and stadia. \"His fame was such that the actor could not walk down the street.\" Kharitonov was a multi-dimensional performer who created a new type of Russian cinematic character: the charming bad egg, which he developed in his characterisations of Brovkin, the policeman Vasya Shaneshkin and his later heroic characters. \"It was skill, hard work, professionalism and above all perception which allowed this sophisticated actor to play so convincingly this simple country boy, Brovkin.\" Much of this was the effect of his training with the psychological acting school of MAT. Private Ivan was followed in 1958 by Ivan Brovkin on the State Farm (see critical commentary below). Later career With age, Kharitonov appeared in fewer films; he did not relish playing older men. However, sometimes he does appear in later movies grey and stout. For this reason of gradual absence from movies, in the 1980s Leonid Kharitonov was almost forgotten as a film actor although he continued performing at his native Moscow Art Theatre, as was the case during almost all his acting life. Private life In private life he was said to live modestly. He was married three times, first to Svetlana Kharitonov the character actress of the 1950s and 1960s. He met his second wife, the actress Gemma Osmolovskaya, on the set of The Street is Full of Surprises, and they had a son Alexei Khartionov who is now a scientist-programmer. His third wife was his student at the Moscow Art Theatre school. Illness In later years Kharitonov was seriously ill. In the summer of 1980, during the Moscow Olympics, he suffered a first stroke. Then, while filming From the Life of the Chief of Criminal Investigation on 4 July 1984 this was followed by a second stroke. His health could not bear the news of the crisis of the Moscow Art Theatre in the summer of 1987. On 20 June 1987, the day of its division into two parts which was a very hard and dramatic time for the theatre, Kharitonov died the same day from his third stroke which occurred in the drama theatre. He was buried in Moscow in plot number 50 of Vagankovskoye cemetery.

He played Fedul VI in Fire, Water, and Brass Pipes (1968). He played the part of Dobchinsky in the comedy Incognito from St. Petersburg (1977). In 1979 he acted in Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears, and A Few Days from the Life of I. I. Oblomov. In Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears he appears in cameo as himself, as part of the setting for the character Rudolf (Yuri Vasilyev) who is a television cameraman and first lover of the protagonist Ekaterina (Vera Alentova). Kharitonov was at that time ubiquitous on Soviet television, and therefore represented the contemporary celebrity media zeitgeist. This cameo part is not unimportant, as director Vladimir Menshov said: \"The uniqueness of the movie Moscow does not believe in tears lies in the fact that there are no bit parts.\"He played the Tsar in Along Unknown Paths(1982). He acted in: Iz Zhizni Nachalnika Ugolovnogo Rozyska (1983); Auktsion (1983); Postoronnim Vkhod Razreshyon (1986); Khorosho Sidim! (1986). He was also in the movie New Year's Abduction which featured the song Dark-Eyed Cossack Girl, publicised by his namesake and friend the bass singer Leonid Kharitonov.

Essentially a story about a nice young Russian boy drafted into the war, the film de-elevated the war film to a level accessible to common viewers, without challenging them to confront its pain. Played by Leonid Kharitonov, whose lyrical performance of several songs from the movie made him an all-Soviet heart throb, Brovkin opened the way for more adventurous films. Similar in story line but very different in treatment was the 1959 film Ballad of a Soldier, directed by Grigory Chukhray, which uses the tale of a young soldier on leave from the war to convey its futility and tragedy.\"James von Geldern Critical commentary on Ivan Brovkin Na Tseline poster The 1958 poster on the left illustrates the innocent face of the Brovkin character as performed by the sophisticated actor Kharitonov. It does this by contrasting the bland expression of the face with the shockingly modern (for 1958) complementary colours of the composition. The pictorial style predates the complementary colourist Andy Warhol's first exhibition of 1962, and demonstrates that it was part of the source-culture for that artist's work, which he called \"artificial colour\". The idea of re-working printed portraiture with gouache paints goes back to the previous century to such artists as Degas. The greyed-out sketch of the supporting actors in the top half of the poster serves to represent and encourage the audience's pleasure at seeing the Brovkin character on screen again. The poster contains another compositional joke or trick, as it appears to ignore the rule of thirds on the vertical axis, while actually fulfilling that visual requirement on the horizontal axis, although discreetly. This cleverness again parallels Kharitonov's clever but hidden acting skills.

He is famous for his discovery in 1909 of well-preserved fossils, including some of the oldest soft-part imprints, in the Burgess Shale of British Columbia, Canada.\n\n  Early life Charles Doolittle Walcott was born on March 31, 1850, in New York Mills, New York. His grandfather, Benjamin S. Walcott, moved from Rhode Island in 1822. His father, also Charles Doolittle Walcott, died when Charles Jr. was only two. Walcott was the youngest of four children. He was interested in nature from an early age, collecting minerals and bird eggs and, eventually, fossils. He attended various schools in the Utica area but left at the age of eighteen without completing high school, the end of his formal education. His interest in fossils solidified as he became a commercial fossil collector.On January 9, 1872, Walcott married Lura Ann Rust, daughter of the owner of a farm in New York where Walcott made one of his most important trilobite discoveries (Walcott-Rust quarry). She died on January 23, 1876. Walcott's interest in fossils led to his acquaintance with Louis Agassiz of Harvard University, who encouraged him to work in the field of paleontology; later that year, he began work as the assistant to the state paleontologist, James Hall. He lost this job after two years but was soon recruited to the newly formed US Geological Survey as a geological assistant. Career Walcott began his professional paleontology career by discovering new localities, such as the Walcott-Rust quarry in upstate New York and the Georgia Plane trilobite beds in Vermont, and by selling specimens to Yale University. In 1876, he became the assistant to James Hall, State Geologist of New York. Walcott also became a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1879, Walcott joined the US Geological Survey and rose to become chief paleologist in 1893 and then director in 1894. His work focused on Cambrian strata in locations throughout the United States and Canada; his numerous field trips and fossil discoveries made important contributions to stratigraphy. He married Helena Breese Stevens in 1888. They had four children between 1889 and 1896: Charles Doolittle Walcott, Sydney Stevens Walcott, Helena Breese Walcott, and Benjamin Stuart Walcott. Walcott was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1896. In 1901, he served both as president of the Geological Society of America and the Philosophical Society of Washington. In 1902, he met with Andrew Carnegie and became one of the founders and incorporators of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. He served in various administrative and research positions in that organization. In 1921 Walcott was awarded the inaugural Mary Clark Thompson Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.He served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1923. He was an advisor to then-president Theodore Roosevelt.Walcott had an interest in the conservation movement and assisted its efforts. Smithsonian Walcott became Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in 1907 after the death of Samuel Pierpont Langley, holding the post until his own death. He was succeeded by Charles Greeley Abbot. Because of Walcott's responsibilities at the Smithsonian, he resigned as director of the United States Geological Survey. As part of the centennial celebration of Darwin's birth, Walcott was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Cambridge in 1909. Burgess shale In 1910, the year after his discovery of 508 million year old (middle Cambrian) fossils in the Burgess shale, Walcott returned to the area accompanied by his sons Stuart and Sidney. Together they examined all the layers on the ridge above the point where the fossil-laden rock had been found, eventually finding the fossiliferous band. Between 1910 and 1924, Walcott returned repeatedly to collect more than 65,000 specimens from what is now known as the Walcott Quarry, named after him. The find includes exceptional preservation of the soft parts of its fossils, one of the oldest fossil beds containing soft-part imprints. Walcott's wife Helena died in a train crash in Connecticut in 1911. In 1914, Walcott married his third wife, Mary Morris Vaux, an amateur artist and avid naturalist. She accompanied him on his expeditions, enjoying the study of nature. She made watercolor illustrations of wildflowers as she traveled with him in Canada. Although Walcott spent a considerable amount of time at the Burgess Shale quarry on what became known as Fossil Ridge, he also traveled widely in other areas of the Canadian Rockies. Some of his numerous scientific publications feature spectacular panoramic photographs of the mountains taken from high passes or high on mountain slopes. The NACA In 1914 Walcott convened a conference in Washington, D.C. for the purpose of stimulating interest in aeronautic science, and its relation to the U.S. government. The conference led to an act of congress organizing an Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (later named the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) \"to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution.\" This committee was composed of twelve members, two each from the Army and Navy, one each representing the Smithsonian Institution, the Weather Bureau, and the National Bureau of Standards. Five additional members were chosen \"who shall be acquainted with the needs of aeronautical science, either civil or military, or skilled in aeronautical engineering or its allied sciences\". Brigadier General George P. Scriven, Chief Signal Officer of the Army, was chairman of the committee; Walcott was elected chairman of the Executive Committee. William F. Durand was one of the civilian members of the Committee. Wright Brothers Controversy In light of the Wright brothers patent war and to discredit the Wright brothers, Glenn Curtiss in 1914 helped Walcott secretly make major modifications to a failed aerodrome built in 1903 by Professor Samuel Langley to make it appear able to fly. After the flight demonstrations, Walcott ordered the Langley machine be restored to its 1903 condition to cover up the deception before it was put on display. It took until 1928 for the Smithsonian Board of Regents to pass a resolution acknowledging that the Wright brothers deserved the credit for \"the first successful flight with a power-propelled heavier-than-air machine carrying a man.\" Death and legacy After Walcott's death in Washington, DC, his samples, photographs, and notes remained in storage until their rediscovery by a new generation of paleontologists in the late 1960s. Since then, many of his interpretations have been revised. Walcott would be little known today if he had not been brought to attention by Stephen Jay Gould's book Wonderful Life (1989). In this book, Gould put forth his opinion that Walcott failed to see the differences among the Burgess Shale species and \"shoehorned\" most of these fossils into existing phyla. Many paleontologists would now take a much less negative view of Walcott's descriptions and of the theoretical perspective that shaped them.Walcott's work on Ordovician trilobites of New York also tended to be overlooked until, in the early 1990s, Rochester-based amateur paleontologist Thomas Whiteley revived Walcott's research and re-opened the Walcott\u2013Rust quarry near Russia, New York. This localized stratum has some of the best preserved Laurentian trilobites ever found, including enrolled specimens with soft body parts. The Walcott Peak, near where he first discovered the Burgess Shale on Mount Burgess in Canada, was named after him. The nearby Walcott Quarry, with the Phyllopod bed of Burgess Shale fossils between Wapta Mountain and Mount Field, is also named for him. The Charles Doolittle Walcott Medal is awarded by the National Academy of Sciences every five years for outstanding work in the field of Precambrian and Cambrian life and history.

She is said to have been as strong as the male dancers.  Early life Camargo was born on 15 April 1710, and baptised the same day, in Brussels, the daughter of Ferdinand Joseph de Cupis and Marie-Anne de Smet. She had two younger brothers, Jean-Baptiste who later became a composer and violinist, Fran\u00e7ois Cupis de Renoussard a composer and cellist, and a sister, Madeleine. Her father, who was of Spanish ancestry, earned a meagre living as violinist and dancing-master, and from childhood she was trained for the stage. At ten years of age, she was given lessons by Fran\u00e7oise Pr\u00e9vost (1680\u20131741), then the first dancer at the Paris Op\u00e9ra, and at once obtained an engagement as premiere danseuse, first at Brussels and then at Rouen. Career She made her Paris debut on 5 May 1726 at the Paris Opera Ballet in Les Caract\u00e8res de la Danse. The piece was choreographed by her teacher Fran\u00e7oise Pr\u00e9vost to music by Jean Ferry Rebel. Pr\u00e9vost herself originated the role, and subsequently taught her popular solo to both Camargo and her other student, Marie Sall\u00e9. Camargo dazzled audiences with her stunning technique and spritely energy, performing entrechats and cabrioles with brilliant execution. She became the first woman to execute the entrechat quatre, and she at once became the rage. She popularized two innovations to ballet, changing from heeled shoes to slippers, and she was one of the first ballet-dancers to shorten the skirt to what afterwards became the regulation length. Every new fashion bore her name; her manner of doing her hair was copied by all at court; her shoemaker \u2014 she had a tiny foot \u2014 made his fortune. Her increasing popularity at the Paris Opera inspired jealousy in Pr\u00e9vost, who demoted her to the corps de ballet. However, a later incident involving a missing male dancer saw Camargo unexpectedly step into his place and improvise a brilliant solo. This feat secured her status as a principal ballerina. She had many titled admirers whom she nearly ruined by her extravagances, among others Louis de Bourbon, Count of Clermont. At his wish she retired from the stage from 1736 to 1741, resuming her dancing career from 1741 to 1751. After finally retiring, she received a government pension. In her time she appeared in 78 ballets or operas, always to the delight of the public. Nicolas Lancret painted a famous portrait of her that exists in several versions including works now held at the Wallace Collection, London, and at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC (shown right). In them she wears heeled shoes and is poised \u00e0 demi point. A ballet, Camargo, based on the incident when she and her sister Madeleine were abducted by the Comte de Melun in May 1728 was created by Marius Petipa and the composer L\u00e9on Minkus for the Russian Imperial Ballet, premiering December 19, 1872 with the famous ballerina, Ad\u00e8le Grantzow, as Marie Anne Camargo. The work was later revived in 1901 for the Russian Imperial Ballet by Lev Ivanov for Pierina Legnani. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, however, the ballet was never performed again. Death She died on 28 April 1770, thirteen days after her 60th birthday, in Paris.

Influenced by early church reformers such as George Wishart, he joined the movement to reform the Scottish church. He was caught up in the ecclesiastical and political events that involved the murder of Cardinal David Beaton in 1546 and the intervention of the regent Mary of Guise. He was taken prisoner by French forces the following year and exiled to England on his release in 1549.\nWhile in exile, Knox was licensed to work in the Church of England, where he rose in the ranks to serve King Edward VI of England as a royal chaplain. He exerted a reforming influence on the text of the Book of Common Prayer. In England, he met and married his first wife, Margery Bowes. When Mary I ascended the throne of England and re-established Roman Catholicism, Knox was forced to resign his position and leave the country. Knox moved to Geneva and then to Frankfurt. In Geneva, he met John Calvin, from whom he gained experience and knowledge of Reformed theology and Presbyterian polity. He created a new order of service, which was eventually adopted by the reformed church in Scotland. He left Geneva to head the English refugee church in Frankfurt but he was forced to leave over differences concerning the liturgy, thus ending his association with the Church of England.\nOn his return to Scotland, Knox led the Protestant Reformation in Scotland, in partnership with the Scottish Protestant nobility. The movement may be seen as a revolution, since it led to the ousting of Mary of Guise, who governed the country in the name of her young daughter Mary, Queen of Scots. Knox helped write the new confession of faith and the ecclesiastical order for the newly created reformed church, the Kirk. He wrote his five-volume The History of the Reformation in Scotland between 1559 and 1566. He continued to serve as the religious leader of the Protestants throughout Mary's reign. In several interviews with the Queen, Knox admonished her for supporting Catholic practices. After she was imprisoned for her alleged role in the murder of her husband Lord Darnley, and King James VI was enthroned in her stead, Knox openly called for her execution. He continued to preach until his final days.","public_knowledge":"John Knox (c.\u20091514 \u2013 24 November 1572) was a Scottish minister, theologian, and writer who was a leader of the country's Reformation.

He left Geneva to head the English refugee church in Frankfurt but he was forced to leave over differences concerning the liturgy, thus ending his association with the Church of England.\nOn his return to Scotland, Knox led the Protestant Reformation in Scotland, in partnership with the Scottish Protestant nobility. The movement may be seen as a revolution, since it led to the ousting of Mary of Guise, who governed the country in the name of her young daughter Mary, Queen of Scots. Knox helped write the new confession of faith and the ecclesiastical order for the newly created reformed church, the Kirk. He wrote his five-volume The History of the Reformation in Scotland between 1559 and 1566. He continued to serve as the religious leader of the Protestants throughout Mary's reign. In several interviews with the Queen, Knox admonished her for supporting Catholic practices. After she was imprisoned for her alleged role in the murder of her husband Lord Darnley, and King James VI was enthroned in her stead, Knox openly called for her execution. He continued to preach until his final days.  Early life, 1505\u20131546 John Knox was born sometime between 1505 and 1515 in or near Haddington, the county town of East Lothian. His father, William Knox, was a merchant. All that is known of his mother is that her maiden name was Sinclair and that she died when John Knox was a child. Their eldest son, William, carried on his father's business, which helped in Knox's international communications.Knox was probably educated at the grammar school in Haddington. At this time, the priesthood was the only path for those whose inclinations were academic rather than mercantile or agricultural. He proceeded to further studies at the University of St Andrews or possibly at the University of Glasgow. He studied under John Major, one of the greatest scholars of the time. Knox was ordained a Catholic priest in Edinburgh on Easter Eve of 1536 by William Chisholm, Bishop of Dunblane.Knox first appears in public records as a priest and a notary in 1540. He was still serving in these capacities as late as 1543 when he described himself as a \"minister of the sacred altar in the diocese of St. Andrews, notary by apostolic authority\" in a notarial deed dated 27 March. Rather than taking up parochial duties in a parish, he became tutor to two sons of Hugh Douglas of Longniddry. He also taught the son of John Cockburn of Ormiston. Both of these lairds had embraced the new religious ideas of the Reformation. Embracing the Protestant Reformation, 1546\u20131547 Knox did not record when or how he was converted to the Protestant faith, but perhaps the key formative influences on Knox were Patrick Hamilton and George Wishart. Wishart was a reformer who had fled Scotland in 1538 to escape punishment for heresy. He first moved to England, where in Bristol he preached against the veneration of the Virgin Mary. He was forced to make a public recantation and was burned in effigy at the Church of St Nicholas as a sign of his abjuration. He then took refuge in Germany and Switzerland. While on the Continent, he translated the First Helvetic Confession into English. He returned to Scotland in 1544, but the timing of his return was unfortunate. In December 1543, James Hamilton, Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault, the appointed regent for the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, had decided with the Queen Mother, Mary of Guise, and Cardinal David Beaton to persecute the Protestant sect that had taken root in Scotland. Wishart travelled throughout Scotland preaching in favour of the Reformation, and when he arrived in East Lothian, Knox became one of his closest associates. Knox acted as his bodyguard, bearing a two-handed sword in order to defend him. In December 1545, Wishart was seized on Beaton's orders by the Earl of Bothwell and taken to the Castle of St Andrews. Knox was present on the night of Wishart's arrest and was prepared to follow him into captivity, but Wishart persuaded him against this course saying, \"Nay, return to your bairns [children] and God bless you. One is sufficient for a sacrifice.\" Wishart was subsequently prosecuted by Beaton's Public Accuser of Heretics, Archdeacon John Lauder. On 1 March 1546, he was burnt at the stake in the presence of Beaton. Knox had avoided being arrested by Lord Bothwell through Wishart's advice to return to tutoring. He took shelter with Douglas in Longniddry. Several months later he was still in charge of the pupils, the sons of Douglas and Cockburn, who wearied of moving from place to place while being pursued. He toyed with the idea of fleeing to Germany and taking his pupils with him. While Knox remained a fugitive, Beaton was murdered on 29 May 1546, within his residence, the Castle of St Andrews, by a gang of five persons in revenge for Wishart's execution. The assassins seized the castle and eventually their families and friends took refuge with them, about a hundred and fifty men in all. Among their friends was Henry Balnaves, a former secretary of state in the government, who negotiated with England for the financial support of the rebels. Douglas and Cockburn suggested to Knox to take their sons to the relative safety of the castle to continue their instruction in reformed doctrine, and Knox arrived at the castle on 10 April 1547.Knox's powers as a preacher came to the attention of the chaplain of the garrison, John Rough. While Rough was preaching in the parish church on the Protestant principle of the popular election of a pastor, he proposed Knox to the congregation for that office. Knox did not relish the idea. According to his own account, he burst into tears and fled to his room. Within a week, however, he was giving his first sermon to a congregation that included his old teacher, John Major. He expounded on the seventh chapter of the Book of Daniel, comparing the Pope with the Antichrist. His sermon was marked by his consideration of the Bible as his sole authority and the doctrine of justification by faith alone, two elements that would remain in his thoughts throughout the rest of his life. A few days later, a debate was staged that allowed him to lay down additional theses including the rejection of the Mass, Purgatory, and prayers for the dead. Confinement in the French galleys, 1547\u20131549 John Knox's chaplaincy of the castle garrison was not to last long. While Hamilton was willing to negotiate with England to stop their support of the rebels and bring the castle back under his control, Mary of Guise decided that it could be taken only by force and requested the king of France, Henry II to intervene. On 29 June 1547, 21 French galleys approached St Andrews under the command of Leone Strozzi, prior of Capua. The French besieged the castle and forced the surrender of the garrison on 31 July. The Protestant nobles and others, including Knox, were taken prisoner and forced to row in the French galleys. The galley slaves were chained to benches and rowed throughout the day without a change of posture while an officer watched over them with a whip in hand. They sailed to France and navigated up the Seine to Rouen. The nobles, some of whom would have an impact later in Knox's life such as William Kirkcaldy and Henry Balnaves, were sent to various castle-prisons in France. Knox and the other galley slaves continued to Nantes and stayed on the Loire throughout the winter. They were threatened with torture if they did not give proper signs of reverence when mass was performed on the ship. Knox recounted an incident in which one of the prisoners\u2014possibly himself, as Knox tended to narrate personal anecdotes in the third person\u2014was required to show devotion to a picture of the Virgin Mary. The prisoner was told to give it a kiss of veneration. He refused and when the picture was pushed up to his face, the prisoner seized the picture and threw it into the sea, saying, \"Let our Lady now save herself: she is light enough: let her learn to swim.\" After that, according to Knox, the Scottish prisoners were no longer forced to perform such devotions.In summer 1548, the galleys returned to Scotland to scout for English ships. Knox's health was now at its lowest point due to the severity of his confinement. He was ill with a fever and others on the ship were afraid for his life. Even in this state, Knox recalled, his mind remained sharp and he comforted his fellow prisoners with hopes of release. While the ships were lying offshore between St Andrews and Dundee, the spires of the parish church where he preached appeared in view. James Balfour, a fellow prisoner, asked Knox whether he recognised the landmark. He replied that he knew it well, recognising the steeple of the place where he first preached and he declared that he would not die until he had preached there again.In February 1549, after spending a total of 19 months in the galley-prison, Knox was released. It is uncertain how he obtained his liberty. Later in the year, Henry II arranged with Edward VI of England the release of all remaining Castilian prisoners. Exile in England, 1549\u20131554 On his release, Knox took refuge in England. The Reformation in England was a less radical movement than its Continental counterparts, but there was a definite breach with Rome. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, and the regent of King Edward VI, the Duke of Somerset, were decidedly Protestant-minded. However, much work remained to bring reformed ideas to the clergy and to the people. On 7 April 1549, Knox was licensed to work in the Church of England. His first commission was in Berwick-upon-Tweed. He was obliged to use the recently released 1549 Book of Common Prayer, which maintained the structure of the Sarum Rite while adapting the content to the doctrine of the reformed Church of England. Knox, however, modified its use to accord with the doctrinal emphases of the Continental reformers. In the pulpit, he preached Protestant doctrines with great effect as his congregation grew. In England, Knox met his wife, Margery Bowes (died c.\u20091560). Her father, Richard Bowes (died 1558), was a descendant of an old Durham family and her mother, Elizabeth Aske, was an heiress of a Yorkshire family, the Askes of Richmondshire. Elizabeth presumably met Knox when he was employed in Berwick. Several letters reveal a close friendship between them. It is not recorded when Knox married Margery Bowes. Knox attempted to obtain the consent of the Bowes family, but her father and her brother Robert Bowes were opposed to the marriage.Towards the end of 1550, Knox was appointed a preacher of St Nicholas' Church in Newcastle upon Tyne. The following year he was appointed one of the six royal chaplains serving the King. On 16 October 1551, John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, overthrew the Duke of Somerset to become the new regent of the young King. Knox condemned the coup d'\u00e9tat in a sermon on All Saints Day. When Dudley visited Newcastle and listened to his preaching in June 1552, he had mixed feelings about the firebrand preacher, but he saw Knox as a potential asset. Knox was asked to come to London to preach before the Court. In his first sermon, he advocated a change for the 1552 Book of Common Prayer. The liturgy required worshippers to kneel during communion. Knox and the other chaplains considered this to be idolatry. It triggered a debate where Archbishop Cranmer was called upon to defend the practice. The end result was a compromise in which the famous Black Rubric, which declared that no adoration is intended while kneeling, was included in the second edition.Soon afterwards, Dudley, who saw Knox as a useful political tool, offered him the bishopric of Rochester. Knox refused, and he returned to Newcastle. On 2 February 1553 Cranmer was ordered to appoint Knox as vicar of All Hallows, Bread Street, in London, placing him under the authority of the Bishop of London, Nicholas Ridley. Knox returned to London in order to deliver a sermon before the King and the Court during Lent and he again refused to take the assigned post. Knox was then told to preach in Buckinghamshire and he remained there until Edward's death on 6 July. Edward's successor, Mary Tudor, re-established Roman Catholicism in England and restored the Mass in all the churches. With the country no longer safe for Protestant preachers, Knox left for the Continent in January 1554 on the advice of friends. On the eve of his flight, he wrote: Sometime I have thought that impossible it had been, so to have removed my affection from the realm of Scotland, that any realm or nation could have been equal dear to me. But God I take to record in my conscience, that the troubles present (and appearing to be) in the realm of England are double more dolorous unto my heart than ever were the troubles of Scotland. From Geneva to Frankfurt and Scotland, 1554\u20131556 Knox disembarked in Dieppe, France, and continued to Geneva, where John Calvin had established his authority. When Knox arrived Calvin was in a difficult position. He had recently overseen the Company of Pastors, which prosecuted charges of heresy against the scholar Michael Servetus, although Calvin himself was not capable of voting for or against a civil penalty against Servetus. Knox asked Calvin four difficult political questions: whether a minor could rule by divine right, whether a female could rule and transfer sovereignty to her husband, whether people should obey ungodly or idolatrous rulers, and what party godly persons should follow if they resisted an idolatrous ruler. Calvin gave cautious replies and referred him to the Swiss reformer Heinrich Bullinger in Z\u00fcrich. Bullinger's responses were equally cautious, but Knox had already made up his mind. On 20 July 1554, he published a pamphlet attacking Mary Tudor and the bishops who had brought her to the throne. He also attacked the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, calling him \"no less enemy to Christ than was Nero\".In a letter dated 24 September 1554, Knox received an invitation from a congregation of English exiles in Frankfurt to become one of their ministers. He accepted the call with Calvin's blessing. But no sooner had he arrived than he found himself in a conflict. The first set of refugees to arrive in Frankfurt had subscribed to a reformed liturgy and used a modified version of the Book of Common Prayer. More recently arrived refugees, however, including Edmund Grindal, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, favoured a stricter application of the book. When Knox and a supporting colleague, William Whittingham, wrote to Calvin for advice, they were told to avoid contention. Knox therefore agreed on a temporary order of service based on a compromise between the two sides. This delicate balance was disturbed when a new batch of refugees arrived that included Richard Cox, one of the principal authors of the Book of Common Prayer. Cox brought Knox's pamphlet attacking the emperor to the attention of the Frankfurt authorities, who advised that Knox leave. His departure from Frankfurt on 26 March 1555 marked his final breach with the Church of England.After his return to Geneva, Knox was chosen to be the minister at a new place of worship petitioned from Calvin. As such, he exerted an influence on French Protestants, whether they were exiled in Geneva or in France. In the meantime, Elizabeth Bowes wrote to Knox, asking him to return to Margery in Scotland, which he did at the end of August. Despite initial doubts about the state of the Reformation in Scotland, Knox found the country significantly changed since he was carried off in the galley in 1547. When he toured various parts of Scotland preaching the reformed doctrines and liturgy, he was welcomed by many of the nobility including two future regents of Scotland, the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Mar.Though the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, made no move against Knox, his activities caused concern among the church authorities. The bishops of Scotland viewed him as a threat to their authority and summoned him to appear in Edinburgh on 15 May 1556. He was accompanied to the trial by so many influential persons that the bishops decided to call the hearing off. Knox was now free to preach openly in Edinburgh. William Keith, the Earl Marischal, was impressed and urged Knox to write to the Queen Regent. Knox's unusually respectful letter urged her to support the Reformation and overthrow the church hierarchy. Queen Mary took the letter as a joke and ignored it. Return to Geneva, 1556\u20131559 Shortly after Knox sent the letter to the Queen Regent, he suddenly announced that he felt his duty was to return to Geneva. In the previous year on 1 November 1555, the congregation in Geneva had elected Knox as their minister and he decided to take up the post. He wrote a final letter of advice to his supporters and left Scotland with his wife and mother-in-law. He arrived in Geneva on 13 September 1556.For the next two years, he lived a happy life in Geneva. He recommended Geneva to his friends in England as the best place of asylum for Protestants. In one letter he wrote: I neither fear nor eschame to say, is the most perfect school of Christ that ever was in the earth since the days of the apostles. In other places I confess Christ to be truly preached; but manners and religion so sincerely reformed, I have not yet seen in any other place ... Knox led a busy life in Geneva. He preached three sermons a week, each lasting well over two hours. The services used a liturgy that was derived by Knox and other ministers from Calvin's Formes des Pri\u00e8res Eccl\u00e9siastiques. The church in which he preached, the \u00c9glise de Notre Dame la Neuve\u2014now known as the Auditoire de Calvin\u2014had been granted by the municipal authorities, at Calvin's request, for the use of the English and Italian congregations. Knox's two sons, Nathaniel and Eleazar, were born in Geneva, with Whittingham and Myles Coverdale their respective godfathers.In the summer of 1558, Knox published his best-known pamphlet, The first blast of the trumpet against the monstruous regiment of women. In calling the \"regimen\" or rule of women \"monstruous\", he meant that it was \"unnatural\". Knox states that his purpose was to demonstrate \"how abominable before God is the Empire or Rule of a wicked woman, yea, of a traiteresse and bastard\". The women rulers that Knox had in mind were Queen Mary I of England and Mary of Guise, the Dowager Queen of Scotland and regent on behalf of her daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots. This biblical position was not unusual in Knox's day; however, even he was aware that the pamphlet was dangerously seditious. He therefore published it anonymously and did not tell Calvin, who denied knowledge of it until a year after its publication, that he had written it. In England, the pamphlet was officially condemned by royal proclamation. The impact of the document was complicated later that year when Elizabeth Tudor became Queen of England. Although Knox had not targeted Elizabeth, he had deeply offended her, and she never forgave him. With a Protestant on the throne, the English refugees in Geneva prepared to return home. Knox himself decided to return to Scotland. Before his departure, various honours were conferred on him, including the freedom of the city of Geneva. Knox left in January 1559, but he did not arrive in Scotland until 2 May 1559, owing to Elizabeth's refusal to issue him a passport through England. Revolution and end of the regency, 1559\u20131560 Two days after Knox arrived in Edinburgh, he proceeded to Dundee where a large number of Protestant sympathisers had gathered. Knox was declared an outlaw, and the Queen Regent summoned the Protestants to Stirling. Fearing the possibility of a summary trial and execution, the Protestants proceeded instead to Perth, a walled town that could be defended in case of a siege. At the church of St John the Baptist, Knox preached a fiery sermon and a small incident precipitated into a riot. A mob poured into the church and it was soon gutted. The mob then attacked two friaries (Blackfriars and Greyfriars) in the town, looting their gold and silver and smashing images. Mary of Guise gathered those nobles loyal to her and a small French army. She dispatched the Earl of Argyll and Lord Moray to offer terms and avert a war. She promised not to send any French troops into Perth if the Protestants evacuated the town. The Protestants agreed, but when the Queen Regent entered Perth, she garrisoned it with Scottish soldiers on the French payroll. This was seen as treacherous by Lord Argyll and Lord Moray, who both switched sides and joined Knox, who now based himself in St Andrews. Knox's return to St Andrews fulfilled the prophecy he made in the galleys that he would one day preach again in its church. When he did give a sermon, the effect was the same as in Perth. The people engaged in vandalism and looting. In June 1559, a Protestant mob incited by the preaching of John Knox ransacked the cathedral; the interior of the building was destroyed. The cathedral fell into decline following the attack and became a source of building material for the town. By 1561 it had been abandoned and left to fall into ruin. With Protestant reinforcements arriving from neighbouring counties, the Queen Regent retreated to Dunbar. By now, the mob fury had spilled over central Scotland. Her own troops were on the verge of mutiny. On 30 June, the Protestant Lords of the Congregation occupied Edinburgh, though they were able to hold it for only a month. But even before their arrival, the mob had already sacked the churches and the friaries. On 1 July, Knox preached from the pulpit of St Giles', the most influential in the capital. The Lords of the Congregation negotiated their withdrawal from Edinburgh by the Articles of Leith signed 25 July 1559, and Mary of Guise promised freedom of conscience.Knox knew that the Queen Regent would ask for help from France, so he negotiated by letter under the assumed name John Sinclair with William Cecil, Elizabeth's chief adviser, for English support. Knox sailed secretly to Lindisfarne, off the northeast coast of England at the end of July, to meet James Croft and Sir Henry Percy at Berwick upon Tweed. Knox was indiscreet and news of his mission soon reached Mary of Guise. He returned to Edinburgh telling Croft he had to return to his flock, and suggested that Henry Balnaves should go to Cecil.When additional French troops arrived in Leith, Edinburgh's seaport, the Protestants responded by retaking Edinburgh. This time, on 24 October 1559, the Scottish nobility formally deposed Mary of Guise from the regency. Her secretary, William Maitland of Lethington, defected to the Protestant side, bringing his administrative skills. From then on, Maitland took over the political tasks, freeing Knox for the role of religious leader. For the final stage of the revolution, Maitland appealed to Scottish patriotism to fight French domination. Following the Treaty of Berwick, support from England finally arrived and by the end of March, a significant English army joined the Scottish Protestant forces. The sudden death of Mary of Guise in Edinburgh Castle on 10 June 1560 paved the way for an end to hostilities, the signing of the Treaty of Edinburgh, and the withdrawal of French and English troops from Scotland. On 19 July, Knox held a National Thanksgiving Service at St Giles'. Reformation in Scotland, 1560\u20131561 On 1 August, the Scottish Parliament met to settle religious issues. Knox and five other ministers, all called John, were called upon to draw up a new confession of faith. Within four days, the Scots Confession was presented to Parliament, voted upon, and approved. A week later, the Parliament passed three acts in one day: the first abolished the jurisdiction of the Pope in Scotland, the second condemned all doctrine and practice contrary to the reformed faith, and the third forbade the celebration of Mass in Scotland. Before the dissolution of Parliament, Knox and the other ministers were given the task of organising the newly reformed church or the Kirk. They would work for several months on the Book of Discipline, the document describing the organisation of the new church. During this period, in December 1560, Knox's wife, Margery, died, leaving Knox to care for their two sons, aged three and a half and two years old. John Calvin, who had lost his own wife in 1549, wrote a letter of condolence.Parliament reconvened on 15 January 1561 to consider the Book of Discipline. The Kirk was to be run on democratic lines. Each congregation was free to choose or reject its own pastor, but once he was chosen he could not be fired. Each parish was to be self-supporting, as far as possible. The bishops were replaced by ten to twelve \"superintendents\". The plan included a system of national education based on universality as a fundamental principle. Certain areas of law were placed under ecclesiastical authority. The Parliament did not approve the plan, however, mainly for reasons of finance. The Kirk was to be financed out of the patrimony of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland. Much of this was now in the hands of the nobles, who were reluctant to give up their possessions. A final decision on the plan was delayed because of the impending return of Mary, Queen of Scots. Knox and Queen Mary, 1561\u20131564 On 19 August 1561, cannons were fired in Leith to announce Queen Mary's arrival in Scotland. When she attended Mass being celebrated in the royal chapel at Holyrood Palace five days later, this prompted a protest in which one of her servants was jostled. The next day she issued a proclamation that there would be no alteration in the current state of religion and that her servants should not be molested or troubled. Many nobles accepted this, but not Knox. The following Sunday, he protested from the pulpit of St Giles'. As a result, just two weeks after her return, Mary summoned Knox. She accused him of inciting a rebellion against her mother and of writing a book against her own authority. Knox answered that as long as her subjects found her rule convenient, he was willing to accept her governance, noting that Paul the Apostle had been willing to live under Nero's rule. Mary noted, however, that he had written against the principle of female rule itself. He responded that she should not be troubled by what had never harmed her. When Mary asked him whether subjects had a right to resist their ruler, he replied that if monarchs exceeded their lawful limits, they might be resisted, even by force. On 13 December 1562, Mary sent for Knox again after he gave a sermon denouncing certain celebrations which Knox had interpreted as rejoicing at the expense of the Reformation. She charged that Knox spoke irreverently of the Queen in order to make her appear contemptible to her subjects. After Knox gave an explanation of the sermon, Mary stated that she did not blame Knox for the differences of opinion and asked that in the future he come to her directly if he heard anything about her that he disliked. Despite her friendly gesture, Knox replied that he would continue to voice his convictions in his sermons and would not wait upon her.During Easter in 1563, some priests in Ayrshire celebrated Mass, thus defying the law. Some Protestants tried to enforce the law themselves by apprehending these priests. This prompted Mary to summon Knox for the third time. She asked Knox to use his influence to promote religious toleration. He defended their actions and noted she was bound to uphold the laws and if she did not, others would. Mary surprised Knox by agreeing that the priests would be brought to justice.The most dramatic interview between Mary and Knox took place on 24 June 1563. Mary summoned Knox to Holyrood after hearing that he had been preaching against her proposed marriage to Don Carlos, the son of Philip II of Spain. Mary began by scolding Knox, then she burst into tears. \"What have ye to do with my marriage?\" she asked, and \"What are ye within this commonwealth?\" \"A subject born within the same, Madam,\" Knox replied. He noted that though he was not of noble birth, he had the same duty as any subject to warn of dangers to the realm. When Mary started to cry again, he said, \"Madam, in God's presence I speak: I never delighted in the weeping of any of God's creatures; yea I can scarcely well abide the tears of my own boys whom my own hand corrects, much less can I rejoice in your Majesty's weeping.\" He added that he would rather endure her tears, however, than remain silent and \"betray my Commonwealth\". At this, Mary ordered him out of the room.Knox's final encounter with Mary was prompted by an incident at Holyrood. While Mary was absent from Edinburgh on her summer progress in 1563, a crowd forced its way into her private chapel as Mass was being celebrated. During the altercation, the priest's life was threatened. As a result, two of the ringleaders, burgesses of Edinburgh, were scheduled for trial on 24 October 1563. In order to defend these men, Knox sent out letters calling the nobles to convene. Mary obtained one of these letters and asked her advisors if this was not a treasonable act. Stewart and Maitland, wanting to keep good relations with both the Kirk and the Queen, asked Knox to admit he was wrong and to settle the matter quietly. Knox refused and he defended himself in front of Mary and the Privy Council. He argued that he had called a legal, not an illegal, assembly as part of his duties as a minister of the Kirk. After he left, the councillors voted not to charge him with treason. Final years in Edinburgh, 1564\u20131572 On 26 March 1564, Knox stirred controversy again when he married Margaret Stewart, the daughter of an old friend, Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree, a member of the Stuart family and a distant relative of the Queen, Mary Stuart. The marriage was unusual because he was a widower of fifty, while the bride was only seventeen. Very few details are known of their domestic life. They had three daughters, Martha, Margaret, and Elizabeth.When the General Assembly convened in June 1564, an argument broke out between Knox and Maitland over the authority of the civil government. Maitland told Knox to refrain from stirring up emotions over Mary's insistence on having mass celebrated and he quoted from Martin Luther and John Calvin about obedience to earthly rulers. Knox retorted that the Bible notes that Israel was punished when it followed an unfaithful king and that the Continental reformers were refuting arguments made by the Anabaptists who rejected all forms of government. The debate revealed his waning influence on political events as the nobility continued to support Mary.On 29 July 1565, when Mary married Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, some of the Protestant nobles, including James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, rose up in rebellion. Knox revealed his own objection while preaching in the presence of the new King Consort on 19 August 1565. He made passing allusions to ungodly rulers which caused Darnley to walk out. Knox was summoned and prohibited from preaching while the court was in Edinburgh. On 9 March 1566, Mary's secretary, David Rizzio, was murdered by conspirators loyal to Darnley. Mary escaped from Edinburgh to Dunbar and by 18 March returned with a formidable force. Knox fled to Kyle in Ayrshire, where he completed the major part of his magnum opus, History of the Reformation in Scotland. When he returned to Edinburgh, he found the Protestant nobles divided over what to do with Mary. Lord Darnley had been murdered and the Queen almost immediately married the chief suspect, the Earl of Bothwell. The indictment of murder thus upon her, she was forced to abdicate and was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle. Lord Moray had become the regent of King James VI. Other old friends of Knox, Lord Argyll and William Kirkcaldy, stood by Mary. On 29 July 1567, Knox preached James VI's coronation sermon at the church in Stirling. During this period Knox thundered against her in his sermons, even to the point of calling for her death. However, Mary's life was spared, and she escaped on 2 May 1568.The fighting in Scotland continued as a civil war. Lord Moray was assassinated on 23 January 1570. The regent who succeeded him, the Earl of Lennox, was also a victim of violence. On 30 April 1571, the controller of Edinburgh Castle, Kirkcaldy of Grange, ordered all enemies of the Queen to leave the city. But for Knox, his former friend and fellow galley slave, he made an exception. If Knox did not leave, he could stay in Edinburgh, but only if he remained captive in the castle. Knox chose to leave, and on 5 May he left for St Andrews. He continued to preach, spoke to students, and worked on his History. At the end of July 1572, after a truce was called, he returned to Edinburgh. Although by this time exceedingly feeble and his voice faint, he continued to preach at St Giles'.After inducting his successor, James Lawson of Aberdeen, as minister of St Giles' on 9 November, Knox returned to his home for the last time. With his friends and some of the greatest Scottish nobles around him, he asked for the Bible to be read aloud. On his last day, 24 November 1572, his young wife read from Paul's first letter to the Corinthians. A testimony to Knox was pronounced at his grave in the churchyard of St Giles' by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, and newly elected regent of Scotland: \"Here lies one who never feared any flesh\". After the churchyard's destruction in 1633 the precise site of Knox's grave cannot be established. Legacy In his will, Knox claimed: \"None have I corrupted, none have I defrauded; merchandise have I not made.\" The paltry sum of money Knox bequeathed to his family, which would have left them in dire poverty, showed that he had not profited from his work in the Kirk. The regent, Lord Morton, asked the General Assembly to continue paying his stipend to his widow for one year after his death, and the regent ensured that Knox's dependents were decently supported.Knox was survived by his five children and his second wife. Nathaniel and Eleazar, his two sons by his first wife, attended St John's College, Cambridge. Nathaniel became a Fellow of St John's but died early in 1580. Eleazar was ordained into the Church of England and served in the parish of Clacton Magna. He also died young and was buried in the chapel of St John's College in 1591. Knox's second wife, Margaret Knox, got remarried to Andrew Ker, one of those involved in the murder of David Rizzio. Knox's three daughters also married: Martha to Alexander Fairlie; Margaret to Zachary Pont, son of Robert Pont and brother of Timothy Pont; and Elizabeth to John Welsh, a minister of the Kirk.Knox's death was barely noticed at the time. Although his funeral was attended by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in their surviving letters. Mary, Queen of Scots, made only two brief references to him in her letters. However, what the rulers feared were Knox's ideas more than Knox himself. He was a successful reformer and it was this philosophy of reformation that had a great impact on the English Puritans. He has also been described as having contributed to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change. His epitaph reads: \"Here lies one who feared God so much that he never feared the face of any man.\" This is a reference to Matthew 10:28.Knox was notable not so much for the overthrow of Roman Catholicism in Scotland, but for assuring the replacement of the established Christian religion with Presbyterianism rather than Anglicanism. It was thanks to Knox that the Presbyterian polity was established, though it took 120 years following his death for this to be achieved in 1689. Meanwhile, he accepted the status quo and was happy to see his friends appointed bishops and archbishops, even preaching at the inauguration of the Protestant Archbishop of St Andrews John Douglas in 1571. In that regard, Knox is considered the notional founder of the Presbyterian denomination, whose members number millions worldwide.A bust of Knox, by David Watson Stevenson, is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling.

Professional career In December 1929 he moved to Football League Third Division South side Coventry City on professional terms. He spent two seasons with the Sky Blues but failed to gain a regular starting place, making only 16 league appearances and scoring four times. He started the first of two very successful spells at Walsall in September 1931, scoring on his debut in a 2\u20130 win over Doncaster Rovers. He went on to score 15 times in his first season with the Saddlers. In January 1933 he scored the opening goal in Walsall's 2\u20130 win over Herbert Chapman's Arsenal in the FA Cup. A result still regarded as one of the greatest FA Cup upsets of all-time.After a remarkable scoring return of 40 goals in all competitions in 1933\u201334 and 48 goals in all competitions in 1934\u201335, Alsop attracted the attention of clubs further up the league and moved to First Division West Bromwich Albion in November 1935. However, Alsop found his first team opportunities were severely limited by the form of W. G. Richardson and Harry Jones, managing only one league appearance for the club in his two seasons at The Hawthorns.Alsop signed for Ipswich Town in May 1937 and scored 30 goals in 39 senior matches in the Southern League and the Third Division South. He scored in Ipswich's first ever match in the Football League \u2013 a 4\u20132 victory over Southend United in August 1938.He returned to Walsall in October 1938 and, despite the outbreak of war, made a further 106 appearances and continued his prolific goalscoring form for the midlands side. He played his last full season at Fellows Park as player-coach to Walsall's third team in 1947\u201348, before eventually retiring in May 1948. In all competitions, Alsop played 324 times for Walsall and scored 226 goals. Later life Alsop worked behind the scenes at Fellows Park for a further 20 years or so after retiring and later became groundsman of the playing fields adjoining Walsall Arboretum.

Lewis was also part of the Swansea team that beat the touring South Africa team in 1912.  Rugby career Lewis joined Swansea in 1910 and in 1912 was part of the team that faced the touring South Africa national rugby union team. Swansea won the game by a single try, made more impressive by the fact that Lewis was off the field for a quarter of the match. During the game, Lewis took a blow on the bridge of his nose and when he confronted the perpetrator took another blow to his chest which staggered him. Lewis was removed from play to receive treatment, but no action was taken against South Africa. While Lewis was off the pitch, George Hayward was forced to switch to the wing, as substitutions were not part of the rules. Lewis returned to the pitch after twenty minutes to finish the game.Lewis made his Welsh international debut on 1 February 1913 against Scotland as part of the Five Nations Championship. Lewis was one of five new Welsh caps on the day, after a poor game to England in the opening match of the tournament. The very inexperienced team played well under the captaincy of Billy Trew and Wales won 8\u20130. Lewis was reselected for the remaining two games of the Championship, both resulting in Welsh wins, away to France and at home to Ireland. Lewis's last game was the opening match of the 1914 Championship, which saw Wales lose narrowly at Twickenham to England.

Bayley (9 April 1937  \u2013 14 October 2008) was an English science fiction writer.  Biography Bayley was born in Birmingham, England, and educated in Newport, Shropshire. He worked a number of jobs before joining the Royal Air Force during 1955; his first published story, \"Combat's End\", had been printed the year before in Vargo Statten Magazine.During the late 1950s, Bayley became friends and a frequent collaborator with Michael Moorcock on features, comics and short stories, chiefly for Fleetway Publications where he was also a regular writer of text stories, some of which have recently been reprinted by Rebellion Books. He later wrote sf stories for New Worlds magazine and Moorcock, who described himself as \"the dumb one in the partnership\". He, Moorcock and J.G.Ballard met regularly and their discussions and theories led to the development of science fiction's New Wave. His short stories featured regularly in New Worlds and then later in various New Worlds paperback anthologies. His first book, The Star Virus, was followed by more than a dozen other novels; his downbeat, gloomy themes have been cited as influential on the likes of M. John Harrison, William S. Burroughs, Brian Stableford, Bruce Sterling, Iain Banks and Alastair Reynolds.Bayley, who came to live at Donnington, Telford, died of complications from bowel cancer on 14 October 2008. During 2001, he had written an outline for a sequel to Eye of Terror, provisionally titled An Age of Adventure. The novel was unreleased at the time of his death but rumours and listings of copies have circulated, including claims of a 2002 release date and a page count of 288. The book still makes appearances in lists of his works, including the bibliography in the ebooks of Bayley's works released by the Gollancz SF Gateway.

He played quarterback for the University of Tennessee and Texas A&M University.","public_knowledge":"Branndon Stewart (born September 23, 1975) is a former American football player. He played quarterback for the University of Tennessee and Texas A&M University.  High school career Coming out of Stephenville High School led by head coach Art Briles, Stewart was the Texas high school football player of the year and was recruited by virtually every major program in the country, ultimately signing with the University of Tennessee, which had also signed highly regarded quarterback Peyton Manning as part of the same recruiting class. He was inducted into the 2008 Texas High School Football Hall of Fame induction class. College career Stewart played in 11 of 12 games at quarterback for the Volunteers as a true freshman in 1994, but Manning started the final eight games of the season while exhibiting the skills that would make him a perennial All-American and, eventually, All-Pro quarterback. Realizing he was behind a potential four-year starter in the depth chart (as well as future MLB All-Star Todd Helton), Stewart transferred to Texas A&M and sat out the 1995 season, per NCAA transfer rules. Stewart had a nice start to the 1996 season with a big game against BYU in the Pigskin Classic, completing 20 of 28 passes for 232 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. Despite his performance, A&M lost the game 41-37 and went on to a mediocre 6-6 season. Stewart only threw 9 touchdown passes all season and completed less than 50% of his attempts. Stewart began the 1997 season as the Aggies starting quarterback, but in the sixth game of the season (a loss against Kansas State), backup Randy McCown was more effective than Stewart and coach R. C. Slocum named McCown the starter for the following week's game against Texas Tech. When McCown faltered, Stewart came off the bench to complete 12 of 17 second-half passes, only to see the Aggies lose on a 47-yard field goal with 19 seconds to play. That performance was good enough to earn back his starting position. He started the rest of the season, leading the Aggies to the Big 12 South Division championship (the Aggies would go on to lose a very lopsided Big 12 Championship game to the Nebraska Cornhuskers). After the season, Stewart's teammates voted him most valuable offensive player. On the season, he completed 111 of 196 passes for 1,429 yards and 10 touchdowns. He went seven consecutive games without throwing an interception and threw only four all season (two in the championship game against Nebraska). Originally, Stewart's transfer from Tennessee was going to cost him two years of eligibility, but Texas A&M's NCAA compliance officer recommended Stewart appeal for another year of eligibility. The NCAA granted the request, giving him another year with the Aggies. Stewart once again began the 1998 season as the starter, but lost the job to McCown after four games. Going into the Big 12 Championship Game, Stewart had only played in six games, completing 53 of 97 passes for 668 yards, 4 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. His best performance had come against the Oklahoma Sooners, when he passed for 234 yards and two touchdowns. Stewart's chance came once again when McCown injured his left shoulder on a touchdown dive in the last game of the regular season, a 26-24 loss to rival Texas. The injury was not confirmed as a broken collarbone until the Wednesday prior to the Big 12 Championship game against #2 ranked Kansas State. Despite suffering a hyperextended knee in the first quarter, Stewart bounced back to throw for 324 yards and three touchdown passes, including the fabled slant to Sirr Parker that sealed the 36-33 double-overtime victory, earning the Aggies an invitation to the Sugar Bowl in which they lost 24-14 to Ohio State. Despite his ups and downs, Stewart finished his Texas A&M career with a 23-11 record as a starter, and led the Aggies to their first Big 12 Championship and BCS Bowl appearance.

Life Song Giwon was born on July 1, 1947 in the Choseong Township of Boseong County, Jeollanam-do, in South Korea. In 1966, while a student at Joseon High School, his poem \u201cField of Flowers\u201d (Kkotbat) was chosen for a prize in a nationwide writing contest for high school students sponsored by Korea University. Later his poem \u201cSong of the Wind\u201d (Baramui norae) was chosen in a similar contest put on by the Sorabol College of Arts, and in 1967 his poem \u201cOn a Sleepless Night\u201d (Bulmyeonui bame) won a prize in the spring literary contest held by the Chonnam Daily newspaper. In 1968, due to the outcome of the contest, he entered Sorabol College of Arts.His personal life was more tangled. Song Gi-weon was reared from early boyhood by a step-father following his parents\u2019 divorce. His biological father, an alcoholic and opium addict, lay down on railroad tracks in a state of drunkenness and lost his life when Song was just 18. As an unsettled youngster, Song often got into trouble for fighting with his classmates, but he was also a consistent winner at annual literary composition contests, and his literary talent was recognized at a young age. While maintaining a self- deprecatory view of himself as one having \u201cbad blood\u201d, Song's younger years were fueled by his strong desire to be a professional writer.Song Giwon volunteered for service in the Vietnam War in 1970, but was struck by malaria and was sent home after his hospital stay. Song characterizes his Vietnam experience as a self-destructive time in his life when he put himself at death's doorway. After surviving his brush with death, he began writing poems and novels in 1974. At the early stage of his writing career, he began focusing his attention on Korea's oppressive political situation. His self-destructive instinct re-emerged at this time as \u201cresistance.\u201d During the late 1970s, he employed his writing talents as a leading figure in the \u201cDeclaration of the National Political Situation.\u201d Then, in 1980, he was imprisoned for some time for his involvement in the Gim Daejung (then an opposition party leader) Incident. Afterwards, he helped plan and publish several progressive journals (Silcheon munhak, Minjung Gyoyuk, Nodong munhak, etc.) and acted as a leader in the democratization and people's movements, for which he was arrested and imprisoned several times. This temporarily halted his writingStarting in the 1990s, Song was able to return solely to creative writing. Following his travels to India and Myanmar in 1997, he became enraptured with Buddhism and turned to writing about Buddhist themes and self- observation. He has also been an active poet. Work The Wolmunli series of poems written at the beginning of Song Giwon's career affirms the vast distance between peasants and intellectuals and follows the process of discovering the wisdom hidden in the lives of the former. From the perspective of a first-person observer, the author portrays the social conditions of peasants and underscores labor as the mediating activity between man and nature. In doing so he confirms the power of land and explores the possibilities for a connection between intellectuals and peasants.\u201cAt Wolmunli, IV\u201d (Wolmunlieseo IV) contains a scenes at its end in which an old man from North Korea, Cho Mandol, who displays no interest in politics even when the entire nation is clamoring about reuniting separated families, unexpectedly decides to go in search of his younger brother. This last scene is particularly impressive, in that is successfully captures the lives of the peasants and their hard-bred wisdom, both of which sustain themselves without break during the most turbulent of times. Song writes that their lives are \"the hardest sort of earth, and an enormous and mysterious force in that earth which pushes upward to rise through the cracks it will make and the holes it will bore without regard for rock or the sharp edges of hoes or blades of shovels.\" In \u201cAgain at Wolmunli\u201d, the conclusion of the Wolmunli series, the scene in which the protagonist, in prison, hears of his mother's death is repeatedly juxtaposed with the scene of his visit to her grave until the two are brought to an end with the protagonist's conviction that he 'will not live as easily as mother'. The protagonist's appreciation and understanding of his mother, and his own self-revelations at the end of the poem-cycle combine to produce a highly affecting and memorable piece. Song's most recent work, Come to Me, I Will Gladly Go to You (Neoege gama naege ora) is set in a marketplace and portrays the great pains of the common people in their search for love and hope. Although their lives are tainted by despair, insanity, and violence, the author convincingly portrays their corrupt behavior as arising not from a corrupt nature, but from their desolation. Song's lyrical style is here particularly effective in portraying their grotesque lives as possessing a shimmering, haunting beauty.

He represented Amherst division in the Senate of Canada from 1912 to 1931.  Early years Currier was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, to Nathaniel and Hannah Currier. He attended public school until age fifteen, when he was apprenticed to the Boston printing firm of William and John Pendleton. The Pendletons were the first successful lithographers in the United States, lithography having only recently been invented in Europe. Currier learned the process in their shop. He subsequently went to work for M. E. D. Brown in Philadelphia, in 1833. The following year, Currier moved to New York City, where he was to start a new business with John Pendleton. Pendleton backed out, and the new firm became Currier & Stodart, which lasted only one year. Currier & Ives In 1835, Currier started his own lithographic business as an eponymous sole proprietorship. He initially engaged in standard lithographic business of printing sheet music, letterheads, handbills, etc. However, he soon took his work in a new direction, creating pictures of current events. In late 1835, he issued a print illustrating a recent fire in New York. Ruins of the Merchant's Exchange N.Y. after the Destructive Conflagration of Decbr 16 & 17, 1835 was published by the New York Sun, just four days after the fire, and was an early example of illustrated news. In 1840, Currier began to move away from job printing and into independent print publishing. In that year, the Sun published his print Awful Conflagration of the Steam Boat 'Lexington' in Long Island Sound on Monday Eveg Jany 13th 1840, by Which Melancholy Occurrence Over 100 Persons Perished, another documentation of a news event, three days after the disaster; the print sold thousands of copies. In 1850, James Ives came to work for Currier's firm as bookkeeper. Ives' skills as a businessman and marketer contributed significantly to the growth of the company; in 1857 he was made a full partner, and the company became known as Currier & Ives. Currier & Ives are best known as creators of popular art prints, such as Christmas scenes, landscapes, or depictions of Victorian urban sophistication; however, the firm also produced political cartoons and banners, significant historical scenes, and further illustrations of current events. Over the decades, the firm created roughly 7,500 images.Currier retired from his firm in 1880, and turned the business over to his son Edward. Personal life and death Currier married Eliza West Farnsworth in 1840. The couple had one child, Edward West Currier, the next year. Eliza died in 1843. In 1847, Currier married Lura Ormsbee. In addition to being a lithographer, he was also a New York City volunteer fireman in the 1850s. He was a Unitarian. Currier was a friend of P.T. Barnum of Barnum and Bailey fame. Currier was fond of fast horses. He kept several at his Massachusetts residence in a barn he purchased, ordered dismantled, and had delivered by horse to his estate. He died eight years after retiring, on November 20, 1888, at his home on Lion's Mouth Road in Amesbury, Massachusetts. He is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

Context In the first two centuries of the Christian era, it was the local Roman officials who were largely responsible for the persecution of Christians. In the second century, the emperors treated Christianity as a local problem to be dealt with by their subordinates. The number and severity of persecutions of Christians in various locations of the empire seemingly increased during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The extent to which Marcus Aurelius himself directed, encouraged, or was aware of these persecutions is unclear and much debated by historians. Traditional history The traditional account regarding Blandina is reported by Eusebius in his Historia Ecclesiastica. She belongs to the band of martyrs of Lyon who, after some of their number had endured frightful tortures, suffered martyrdom in 177 in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Almost all we know of Blandina comes from a letter sent from the Church of Lyon to the Churches of Asia Minor. Eusebius gives significant space of her life and death in his book as he quotes from the aforementioned epistle to Asia Minor. The fanaticism of the Roman populace in Lyon had been excited against the Christians so that the latter, when they ventured to show themselves publicly, were harassed and ill-treated.While the imperial legate was away, the chiliarch, a military commander, and the duumvir, a civil magistrate, threw a number of Christians, who confessed their faith, into prison. When the legate returned, the imprisoned believers were brought to trial. Among these Christians was Blandina, a slave, who had been taken into custody along with her master, also a Christian. Her companions greatly feared that on account of her bodily frailty she might not remain steadfast under torture. But although the legate caused her to be tortured in a horrible manner, so that even the executioners became exhausted \"as they did not know what more they could do to her\", still she remained faithful and repeated to every question \"I am a Christian, and we commit no wrongdoing.\" Through fear of torture slaves had testified against their masters that the Christians when assembled committed cannibalism and incest, and the legate desired to wring confession of this misconduct from the Christian prisoners. In his report to the emperor the legate stated that those who held to their Christian belief were to be executed and those who denied their faith were to be released, and the legate received instructions from the Emperor Marcus Aurelius allowing the Roman citizens who persisted in the faith to be executed by beheading, but those without citizenship were to be tortured. Blandina was therefore subjected to new tortures with a number of companions in the town's amphitheater (now known as the Amphitheatre of the Three Gauls) at the time of the public games.She was bound to a stake and wild beasts were set on her. According to legend, they did not, however, touch her. After enduring this for a number of days, in an effort to persuade her to recant, she was led into the arena to see the sufferings of her companions. Finally, as the last of the martyrs, she was scourged, placed on a red-hot grate, enclosed in a net and thrown before a wild steer who tossed her into the air with his horns. In the end, she was killed with a dagger. Legacy Her feast is celebrated on June 2. Two communes in France are named after her. See Sainte-Blandine.

Kodnani joined the 12th legislative assembly of Gujarat after being elected to represent the constituency of Naroda as a candidate for the Bharatiya Janata Party.\nIn 2012, Kodnani was sentenced to twenty-eight years' imprisonment for her participation in the Naroda Patiya massacre during the 2002 Gujarat riots but acquitted in 2018 by the Gujarat High Court. Kodnani was one of the most high-profile individuals to be convicted in the case, as well being the only woman among the accused.  Early life Kodnani is the daughter of a Sindhi Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker who moved to India during the Indian Partition. She had her early education in a Gujarati-medium school. She also joined Rashtra Sevika Samiti, the parallel organisation of RSS for women.Kodnani joined the Baroda Medical College from where she did her MBBS and Diploma in Gynaecology and Obstetrics. She set up Shivam Maternity Hospital at Kubernagar in Naroda, Ahmedabad. Political career Kodnani began her political career with Ahmedabad civic elections in 1995. She was elected three times from the Naroda constituency as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the BJP. In 1998, she won the election with a margin of 75,000 votes. In December 2002, shortly after 2002 Gujarat riots, she won by a margin of 110,000 votes. In 2007, her margin increased 180,000 votes. After winning the elections in 2007, she was named as Minister for Women and Child Development of Gujarat in Narendra Modi's BJP government, but resigned from the post in 2009 pending her arrest as accused for the Naroda Patiya massacre. Role in the 2002 Gujarat riots Kodnani was convicted of orchestrating the Naroda Gam and Naroda Patiya massacres of the 2002 Gujarat riots on 28 February 2002, in which 97 Muslims, including 36 women and 35 children, were murdered by stabbing, dismemberment and being burned alive individually as well as in groups. Witnesses testified that Kodnani was at the scene of the crimes, handed out swords to Hindu rioters, exhorted them to attack Muslims and at one point fired a pistol. Bajrang Dal members Suresh Richard and Prakash Rathod told Tehelka's journalists on spy camera that Kodnani drove around Naroda all day, urging the mob to hunt Muslims down and kill them. Mobile phone records also placed her at the scene and showed her to be in regular communication with the top police officials, the Home Minister Gordhan Zadaphia and the Chief Minister's office. The mobile phone records were buried by the police and brought to light by the Nanavati-Mehta Commission in 2004. They were later investigated by R. K. Raghavan-led Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2008. Kodnani ignored notices for deposition by the SIT, which declared her an absconder in February 2009. She obtained an anticipatory bail from a sessions court, which was revoked by the Gujarat High Court on 27 March 2009, leading to her subsequent arrest.She was tried in the Naroda Patiya massacre case and, on 31 August 2012, convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to 28 years in prison. The court judgement called her the \"kingpin of the Naroda Patiya massacre.\" Kodnani continued to maintain her innocence, claiming that she was at the Sola Civil Hospital at the time of the riots, meeting the relatives of Godhra victims.On 17 April 2013, the Gujarat government filed an appeal in the High Court seeking the death penalty for Kodnani but withdrew it on 14 May. In November 2013, she was granted an interim bail of three months for treatment of intestinal tuberculosis. On 30 July 2014, Gujarat High Court granted bail to her on grounds of ill health and suspended her prison sentence. On 20 April 2018, the High Court overturned the trial court's findings and acquitted Maya Kodnani, while upholding the conviction of Suresh Richard and Prakash Rathod. Personal life Maya Kodnani is married to Surendra Kodnani, who is a general physician.

At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former President of Cyprus.  Personal life Clerides was born in Nicosia. He was the eldest son of the lawyer and statesman Ioannis Clerides and Elli Argyridou. He had one sister, Chrysanthi, and one brother, Xanthos. Clerides married Lila Erulkar (31 October 1921 \u2013 6 June 2007), the Indian Jewish daughter of Abraham Erulkar, personal physician to Mahatma Gandhi, in London in 1947. They have a daughter, Katherine (born 1949 in London), who was a member of the House of the Representatives for the Democratic Rally Party. He died on 15 November 2013 at a hospital in Nicosia. World War II During World War II, he served in the British Royal Air Force. In 1942 his airplane was shot down over Germany and he was captured. He remained a prisoner of war until the end of the war. His name was mentioned in dispatches for distinguished services. Post-World War II Following the war, he studied law at King's College London graduated in 1948 as a barrister through Gray's Inn, and later practiced law in Cyprus. He was a member of the EOKA organization that sought the liberation of Cyprus from British Rule and participated in the struggle under the pseudonym \"Ypereides.\" During that period he defended numerous EOKA fighters arrested by the British. One of his most famous accomplishments was a preparation of a dossier that enumerated and provided evidence of instances of Human Rights violations by the Imperial administration of Cyprus and its agents. Cypriot independence Clerides participated in the 1959 London Conference on Cyprus and during the transitional period, from colonial administration to independence (1959\u20131960), he served as Minister of Justice. During the same period he was Head of the Greek Cypriot delegation in the Joint Constitutional Committee. In July 1960, he was elected to the House of Representatives which, in turn, elected him as its first President. He held this position until 22 July 1976. In the first presidential elections Clerides backed Makarios III, the other candidate being his father Ioannis Clerides.Cyprus became independent in 1960, and Clerides gained political power as a member of the United Democratic Party. Following the 15 July 1974 coup d'\u00e9tat in which EOKA B, a Greek Cypriot pro-enosis paramilitary organisation, overthrew the democratically elected Makarios and installed Nikos Sampson as a President with dictatorial powers, Turkey invaded Cyprus. Eight days later, Sampson was forced to resign. On the same day, 23 July 1974, Clerides temporarily assumed the duties of the President of the Republic, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution. He exercised these duties until 7 December 1974, the day of the return of Archbishop Makarios, President of the Republic, who was forced to flee on 16 July 1974 on account of the coup. Both President Makarios and the House of Representatives thanked Glafcos Clerides publicly for the task he performed during that period. Critics, especially from EDEK refer to that period as the post-coup, implying that democracy was not fully restored until the return of Makarios. Clerides on the other hand has repeatedly condemned what he called \"violence and counter violence\" that led to the coup (i.e. the conflict between EOKA-B and \"efedriko\", a special anti-terrorist police body formed to fight EOKA-B). Post-independence From 1961 to 1963 he held the position of President of the Cyprus Red Cross. In recognition of his outstanding services he was awarded a Certificate of Honour and Life Membership in recognition of distinguished services to the Red Cross.In 1976 he founded the right wing Democratic Rally (Demokratikos Synagermos). He was a candidate for the presidency of Cyprus six times and elected to two five-year terms, in 1993 and in 1998. In 1998 his main opponent was Georgios Iakovou. He was defeated in the 2003 presidential election by Tassos Papadopoulos.He was the author of the autobiographical overtoned depiction of 20th century Cypriot history, My Deposition, in four volumes (Alithia Publishing, Cyprus, 1988). Glafcos Clerides is an Honorary Member of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation. Presidency of Cyprus During his presidency (1993\u20132003) Cyprus prospered significantly. Cyprus' stable economy made the island the wealthiest of the ten countries which acceded to the European Union in 2004. The Clerides government is credited with the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. He lost some of his popularity due to his strong support of the Annan Plan for the reunification of Cyprus. While 65% of the Turkish Cypriot community later voted in favor of the plan in a referendum held in 2004, the Greek Cypriot community rejected it by over 75% of the popular vote.

As an amateur, Magee won a bronze medal in the welterweight division at the 1992 World Junior Championships.\nHe was a veteran of the Irish and European professional fight scenes and fought out of the Breen Gym in Belfast, where he now works as an assistant trainer to John Breen.  Biography Magee grew up in the Ardoyne area of Belfast and was in and out of trouble as a youth. Magee came from a boxing obsessed family, at the age of twelve, Magee's mother enrolled him in the local boxing club. Magee stated that for his mother \"boxing was as important as school\". Magee's three older brothers were also boxers; two of them, Terry and Noel, having careers as professional boxers. His brother Noel was also a Commonwealth title champion. In 1989, Magee was involved in a fight outside a restaurant and sustained a deep wound to his neck from which he almost died. In 1992, he was shot in the leg by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in a punishment attack. In 1994, Magee (who is a supporter of Celtic football club) was charged with affray after getting into a barroom brawl with a group of Rangers fans in a Belfast City Centre pub. In February 2004, Magee was attacked in the Blacks Road area of Belfast. He was pulled from his car and beaten, which broke two bones in one of his legs.In February 2010 he was sentenced to six months imprisonment for assault after head-butting a man in north Belfast.In June 2010 Magee was jailed for 12 months for an assault on his ex-partner. He was given the maximum sentence for the offence, but was released on bail pending an appeal.In December 2010 Magee, who is facing charges of breaching a non-molestation order and harassing his ex-partner Maria Magill was arrested and brought back into custody after failing to sign with police on 28 December. During the court hearing it was reported that Magee is sometimes forced to \"lock himself away from the world\" due to mental health problems, depression and anxiety which he has suffered from for a long time. The judge, Mr Justice Weatherup, ruled that Magee could be released again on bail after pointing out that no known attempt had been made to contact Ms Magill.A biography of Magee was published in 2018 titled The Lost Soul of Eamonn Magee and won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year. Amateur record A left-hander, Magee boxed for Ireland as an amateur and, like his brother Noel, won a number of Irish national titles and won a silver medal at the World Junior Championships at San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1989. In 1991, Magee won the Irish National Senior light welterweight title. Barcelona Olympics nomination controversy Because of his Irish title win, Magee should have automatically been nominated as the Irish entrant for the qualification tournament for the boxing event at the 1992 Olympics; however, a number of members from the Ulster Boxing Council abstained from voting for his nomination and this led to the Irish (IABA) selection team requesting that Magee fight a preliminary fight against Corkman Billy Walsh, a boxer whom he had already beaten to win the Irish title. In protest, Magee then turned down the chance to box off for the place, as he felt he was the automatic choice.Magee's outlook on boxing was soured by this experience and he then took a sabbatical from the sport. Professional career Debut Magee turned professional in November 1995, winning his first fight at the Point Depot, in which he knocked out Hull based Liverpudlian Pete Roberts on a card that included Steve Collins and a debut fight for Dubliner Jim Rock. Early fights Magee's first twelve fights took place in a variety of locations such as the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, US and England and against a variety of opposition including journeymen such as Steve McGovern, Kevin McKillan and Karl Taylor as well as future NABF Welter and Light Middleweight title holder Teddy Reid. The Reid fight which took place at The Roxy, Boston, USA, was Magee's only loss on his early record which tallied to 11 win, 9 within the distance and 1 loss. Paul Burke Commonwealth title fights Magee's chance to fight for his first title belt took place on 30 November 1998 when he challenged experienced Preston based fighter Paul Burke for his Commonwealth Light Welterweight Title in Manchester, England on the Mayhem in Manchester bill which included Howard Eastman, Steve Foster and Clinton Woods. Before the fight Magee had stated that Burke was \"old, slow journeyman. Paul is the sort who hangs in and takes far more punishment than he should. I'll do him a favour and get it over fast\".The fight went the twelve round distance and Burke beat Magee on a controversial points decision. Magee thought he had been let down badly by the British officials on the night and Chris Eubank also made his protest known. A journalist who was at ringside stated that it was one of the \"most shocking decisions in British boxing history\".Within twelve months Magee had won two fights both by third round stoppages including winning the Irish Light Welterweight Title both the arranged rematch with Burke which was set for 12 September 1999 at the York Hall, Bethnal Green in London again for the Commonwealth Light Welterweight Title. Magee's mind was on revenge and he floored the champion three times in the sixth round before star rated referee Dave Parris stopped the fight with Burke in no condition to continue.Magee's sights were then set on a fight with Manchester's Ricky Hatton and continued his winning streak with a further ten straight wins, seven inside the distance, including wins over Kenya's Joseph Miyumo, Shea Neary and Jonathan Thaxton to line up a super-fight with Hatton. Hatton fight Magee's highest profile fight was against Ricky Hatton for the WBU Light Welterweight Title which took place at the Manchester Evening News Arena on 1 June 2002 and was billed as \"Anarchy in the UK\" and was a 20,000 ticket sell out.The fight was one of the most eagerly awaited fights in European boxing for many years and there had been doubts that the fight would ever take place due to the MEN being booked and then an injury to Hatton's knuckle. Also Magee had trouble leading up to the fight when the Panamanian sparring partners that Magee had paid for were deported from Ireland after they arrived at Dublin AirportIn what Hatton's trainer Billy Graham called Hatton's toughest fight, Magee knocked Hatton down for the first time in his career after only one minute of the fight in round one. Magee again pressurised Hatton in the second round and again Hatton looked shakey and in trouble. However, Hatton battled back keeping Magee on the ropes for much of the remainder of the fight. Magee eventually lost this keenly contested fight on points over 12 rounds.His most recent fight took place 11 May 2007 and was a unanimous points loss to Kevin Anderson for the British welterweight title.

Palomeque was inducted into the AAA Hall of Fame in June 2013.  Early life Andr\u00e9s Alejandro Palomeque Gonz\u00e1lez was born July 1, 1971, in Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico. Palomeque started to get interested in professional wrestling at the age of nine when his father, Juan Francisco Palomeque Torres, took him to his first wrestling event. Later the Palomeque Family moved to Poza Rica where a young Palomeque took up Pentathlon (long jump, high jump, 110 metres hurdles run, shot put, 1500 metres run) in school. He and his brother, C\u00e9sar Palomeque, had an interest in Martial Arts and trained together for years. When Palomeque was thirteen years old he began working in a gymnasium where professional wrestlers were trained, initially he paid for the use of the gymnasium by cleaning it after hours. When the family moved back to the Tabasco region he began training under Don Nerio Soto, who worked under the ring name El Noruego (the Norwegian), and his brother Delio Soto to become a luchador, or professional wrestler. Professional wrestlers perform in a non-competitive sport based on simulated fighting with storylines written by creative teams and matches with predetermined results. Don Soto later recollects how he and his family took the young man in and made him part of their family, practically adopting him while he was enrolled in Soto's wrestling school and later as he worked on the local wrestling circuit. Palomeque made his professional wrestling debut in 1987, at the age of 16, under the ring name \"Alex Dinamo\". Professional wrestling career Palomeque received further training from famous Mexican wrestling coaches Diablo Velasco and Ray Mendoza before changing his character and ring name to \"Peque\u00f1o Samurai\"\u2014a masked persona patterned after the Japanese Samurai tradition. In 1991, Palomeque began working for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL; Spanish for \"World Wrestling Council\"), the biggest wrestling promotion in Mexico at that time. In CMLL, he worked as Furor, another masked ring persona. While working as Furor, Palomeque won his first Luchas de apuestas, or \"bet match\" when he defeated his mentor El Noruego in a match where Noruego's hair and Palomeque's mask was at stake. Winners In 1992 CMLL head writer Antonio Pe\u00f1a left the company to create his own wrestling promotion Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n (AAA; Spanish for \"Assistance, Consulting and Administration\") promotion; Palomeque was one of the many young wrestlers who left CMLL to work for the newly formed AAA. In AAA, his ring personal was changed and he became \"Winners\" (sometimes written Winner's), a fan favorite character (known as a T\u00e9cnico in Lucha Libre) who wore a silver bodysuit and mask. Palomeques work as \"Winners\" earned him a match on the very first Tripleman\u00eda where he teamed with Super Cal\u00f3 and El Salsero to defeat the team of May Flowers, Rudy Reyna, and Baby Sharon in a Six Man Tag Team match. The following year at Tripleman\u00eda II-A he teamed up with Rey Misterio and Rey Misterio Jr. to defeat the team known as Los Destructores (Tony Arce, Vulcano, and Rocco Valente). In 1995, Winners participated in a Relevos Suicidas Tag Team match, in which the losing team members have a match of their own, with the loser of that encounter being forced to unmask. Winners team won the match, keeping him from having to defend his mask in a match. Eight days later at Tripleman\u00eda III-B, Winners' mask was on the line in a match against Marabunta; Winners defeated Marabunta in a Luchas de Apuestas, Mask vs. Mask match. On June 30, 1995, at Tripleman\u00eda III-C, Winners participated in another \"mask vs. mask\" match, his third in three weeks. This time, Winners was not successful, as he lost to Super Cal\u00f3 and was forced to unmask. The loss of the mask did not hurt Winners' popularity, on the contrary it intensified as the hansome Palomeque became even more popular with the female fans. Despite losing his mask to Super Cal\u00f3 the two continued to work together as a team. On June 15, 1996, Winners and Cal\u00f3 teamed up with Rey Misterio Jr. and Oro Jr. to defeat the team of Perro Silva, Halloween, Kraken, and Mosco de la Merced at Tripleman\u00eda IV-B. A month later, Winners, Cal\u00f3, La Parka and El Mexicano defeated Jerry Estrada, Fishman, Villano IV, and May Flowers in one of the featured matches of Tripleman\u00eda IV-C. Abismo Negro In January 1997, Palomeque's character was changed from that of the quintessential heroic ladies' man known as \"Winners\", to that of a cheating villain (referred to as a Rudo) known as \"Abismo Negro\". Part of his new routine as Abismo Negro was a flamethrower display, created by using a lighter and an Aerosol spray can. Palomeque would regularly use this during his entrance and on occasion during a match as when he worked as \"Abismo Negro\" character. As part of his Rudo act Palomeque began using the Marinete \u2014 a wrestling move known as a Piledriver where he simulates driving the top of his opponents' head into the mat \u2014 the Marinete is \"banned\" Mexican wrestling, which means that it can lead to a disqualification if used during the match. The Marinete became such a signature move for the Abismo Negro character that he earned the nickname El Rey del Martinete (The King of the Piledriver). He made his debut as Abismo Negro on January 10, 1997, in an Eight Man Tag Team match. Shortly after his debut as Abismo Negro, he made his World Wrestling Federation (WWF) debut on the January 19, 1997, episode of the WWF Free For All pay-per-view event pre\u2013show before the 1997 Royal Rumble. On the telecast, Negro teamed with Heavy Metal and Histeria in a losing effort against the team of Octag\u00f3n, Blue Demon Jr., and Tinieblas Jr. in a six-man tag team match. This match was one of the early results of a working relationship between the WWF and AAA that had been created in late 1996. The relationship saw Negro make an appearance in January against Perro Aguayo Jr. and two appearances on the WWF's primary television program Monday Night Raw in March 1997. During his appearances in March, Negro was announced as being part of Los Vipers, a recently created alliance of wrestlers. After March, Negro did not make any more appearances for the WWF. In AAA, Cibern\u00e9tico formed Los Vipers with Negro along with Psicosis (II), Mosco De La Merced, Maniaco and Histeria. Histeria was replaced a few weeks later by Histeria II. In 1998, Negro acquired a \"mascot\": a midget wrestler called Mini Abismo Negro. Abismo, Mini Abismo, and new Vipers member Electroshock were defeated by Octag\u00f3n, his mascot Octag\u00f3ncito, and Pentag\u00f3n in a six-man tag team match at Tripleman\u00eda. Los Vipers engaged in several scripted rivalries with other AAA groups, such as the group of masked wrestlers dressed as clowns known as Los Payasos. They also had a long-running rivalry with Los Vatos Locos\u2014consisting of Espiritu, Picudo, Nygma, May Flowers, and Silver Cat during the rivalry\u2014over the Mexican National At\u00f3micos Championship. Los Vipers won the At\u00f3micos titles from Los Vatos on several occasions, but Negro was not part of the teams that won. Palomeque wrestling as Abismo Negro did capture a title of his own when he defeated Pentag\u00f3n on May 19, 1998, to win the Mexican National Middleweight Championship, a title he held until January 1999.In 1999, Los Vipers split into two factions, with Abismo Negro leading a splinter group called Los Vipers Extreme consisting of Electroshock, Pentag\u00f3n, Shiima, El Cuervo and Mini Abismo Negro while Cibern\u00e9tico created a group called Los Vipers Primera Clase (First Class Vipers). After less than two months, the angle was dropped and Los Vipers reunited. Not long after Los Vipers reunited, Cibern\u00e9tico formed a group called Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), a group intent on taking over AAA that was inspired by World Championship Wrestling's New World Order. Los Vipers became a subgroup within LLL, and Negro assumed leadership of Los Vipers. On May 2, 1999, Negro and Electroshock teamed up to defeat Perro Aguayo and Perro Aguayo Jr. to win the Mexican National Tag Team Championship. Los Vipers held the tag team title for four months before losing it to the team of Haytor and the Panther.In 2000, Palomeque participated in a AAA tour of Japan and competed at Tripleman\u00eda VIII, where he was on the losing side of an eight-man tag team match main event; Negro teamed with Cibernetico, Shiima Nobunaga and Electro Shock against Octag\u00f3n, Jushin Thunder Liger, Latin Lover and Cuije. While touring with AAA, Palomeuqe also made an appearance at Michinoku Pro's April 9 Sumo Hall card, where he defeated Oriental. On May 7, Abismo Negro and Electroshock regained the Mexican National Tag Team title by defeating Haytor and the Panther but only held on to the title for two months before losing it to H\u00e9ctor Garza and Perro Aguayo Jr. Negro became one of the driving forces in LLL's feud with AAA owner Antonio Pe\u00f1a and his AAA loyalists. Over the years, Negro feuded with the top t\u00e9cnicos of AAA such as La Parka Jr., Octag\u00f3n and Latin Lover. Negro's position as one of AAA's top workers was cemented on March 5, 2000, when he competed in AAA's annual Rey de Reyes tournament. In the opening round, he defeated Dos Caras, Killer and Psicosis II and in the finals, he defeated El Alebrije, Charly Manson and Cibern\u00e9tico to win the 2000 Rey de Reyes tournament. Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibern\u00e9tico and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead Los Vipers. On September 29, 2000, Negro defeated Cibern\u00e9tico in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo (2000). When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerra de Titanes (2000), the match ended without a winner, after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put on the back burner. In 2001, Negro almost won Rey de Reyes again, but La Parka Jr. defeated him in the finals. His string of losses continued at Tripleman\u00eda IX, where the LLL team of Abismo Negro, Cibern\u00e9tico, Electroshock and Mascara Maligna lost to Mascara Sagrada, El Alebrije, Octag\u00f3n and La Parka Jr. when Negro was forced to submit.In 2000 Abismo Negro won the hair of the Panther in Lucha del reves match, a contest where two masked wrestlers put their hair on the line instead of their mask. On September 7, 2001 Abismo Negro won another Lucha del reves match, defeating El Alebrije. In December 2002, Negro and Mini Abismo Negro made it to the finals of a tournament to crown the first ever AAA Mascot Tag Team Champions but lost to Mascara Sagrada and Mascarita Sagrada. Negro qualified for the Rey de Reyes (2003) final, but La Parka Jr. once again defeated him. In 2004, LLL was phased out in favor of a new super group known as La Legi\u00f3n Extranjera or the Foreign Legion in English, which meant that Los Vipers now regularly teamed with foreign wrestlers, especially NWA-TNA performers such as Abyss. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling In 2004, TNA and AAA began a working relationship that saw TNA wrestlers work in Mexico and AAA wrestlers make several appearances on TNA's weekly pay-per-views. Managed by AAA owner Antonio Pe\u00f1a, Palomeque, working as Abismo Negro, along with H\u00e9ctor Garza, Juventud Guerrera, Mr. \u00c1guila, and later Heavy Metal, worked for TNA as Team AAA in the TNA 2004 America's X Cup Tournament. The team made their debut on January 28, 2004, at TNA Weekly pay-per-view event #78, defeating the team of Eric Young, Shark Boy, Matt Stryker and Chad Collyer. In the following weeks, Negro and Team AAA won against Elix Skipper, the team of Jerry Lynn and Sonjay Dutt and finally all of Team USA in a 4 on 4 match to claim the Americas X Cup. Four weeks later Team AAA successfully defended the X Cup against Team Canada, as Abismo Negro and Juventud Guerrera defeated the team of Teddy Hart and Jack Evans to tie the score between the two teams, allowing for a final four-on-four elimination match that Team AAA won.Abismo Negro and the rest of Team AAA returned for the 2004 World X Cup Tournament where they now competed as \"Team Mexico\". Abismo Negro remained undefeated until April 7, 2004, when his team lost to James Mason and Jason Allgood in one of the first matches of the World X Cup Tournament. Later in the night, Team Mexico defeated Team UK to even the score. The World Cup saw Team Mexico lose to Team USA, Team Canada (Eric Young and Bobby Roode), and Team Japan (Ryuji Hijikata and Mitsu Hirai Jr.). Team Mexico tied in points with Team USA and Team Canada, which meant that a representative of each team met in an Ultimate X match to determine the winner of the tournament. H\u00e9ctor Garza represented Mexico, but in the end Team USA's Chris Sabin won the match and the tournament. Return to AAA After the World X Cup tournament ended, Negro returned to AAA full-time taking full charge of Los Vipers. In early 2005, he was once again involved in the final match of that year's Rey de Reyes, but La Parka Jr. defeated him for the third time. AAA hinted at a possible t\u00e9cnico turn when Negro, along with Psicosis and Mini Psicosis, attacked Cibern\u00e9tico. The two faced off in a cage match, won by Cibern\u00e9tico, but they eventually reconciled their differences once more. At some point after 2005, Abismo Negro won the hair of Stuka Jr. in a Lucha del reves match. Despite rumors that he was jumping to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre, Negro remained in AAA and was sent on a tour with Pro Wrestling Noah in the spring of 2006. Later in the year, he finally turned t\u00e9cnico and began a sustained storyline with Cibern\u00e9tico and his group La Secta Cibernetica. The on again, off again storyline with Cibern\u00e9tico was put on hold when Cibern\u00e9tico suffered a severe knee injury in late 2006. At some point during 2006, Los Vipers left La Legi\u00f3n due to their \"Anti-Mexican\" philosophy and began fighting La Legi\u00f3n and La Legi\u00f3n's imported wrestlers. At Verano de Escandalo (2006), Negro, Charly Manson, Electroshock and Histeria lost to Team TNA (Homicide, Low Ki, Samoa Joe and A.J. Styles). Black Abyss In late 2007, AAA created a ring persona for a new wrestler called Black Abyss; the gimmick featured the same mask and attire as Negro and used a similar wrestling style to Negro as well. Initially, it was believed that this was done because there were rumors of him jumping to CMLL or to cover several no-shows. In 2008, Negro's \"almost winning\" streak at Rey de Reyes continued as he lost in the final to El Zorro. Black Abyss made sure Negro did not win but interfering on Zorro's behalf during the match, furthering the storyline between the two. During the fall of 2008, AAA pushed the storyline further by having Black Abyss \"injure\" Negro with his own trademark move the \"Martinete\". Abismo Negro was scheduled to take part in Tripleman\u00eda XVI in a match where he would face Los Vipers (Psicosis, Histeria, Black Abyss and Mr. Niebla) in a cage match, but in the weeks leading up to the show Abismo Negro suffered an injury and the match had to be cancelled, AAA used the attack at Rey de Reyes as a storyline explanation of why the match did not take place. At the 2008 Guerra de Titanes, Negro returned to challenge Los Vipers' Revolution and specifically Black Abyss. Subsequently, the storyline between Negro and Black Abyss seemed to be building to a Luchas de Apuestas fight between the two, with their masks on the line. Both Abismo and Black Abyss were booked in the same four-way elimination match qualifier at the Rey de Reyes (2009) event. Negro was able to eliminate Black Abyss from the match but was in turn eliminated by Latin Lover. Black Abyss still competed under the Black Abyss name, still as a rudo, but seemingly only a couple times on TV since then. Black Abyss has stated his wishes to continue with the character to honor the memory of Abismo Negro, but AAA didn't shown a lot of interest in using it on TV. In October 2010 it was reported that Black Abyss had left AAA. Abismo Negro II On September 27, 2011, AAA announced the start of a competition to find a new Abismo Negro. In the end no one was chosen to take over the Abismo Negro character. Personal life Palomeque was married to a woman named Martha for 15 years and the couple had four children, two girls and two boys. Palomeque's wife has been suffering from breast cancer for a number of years.He often appeared on the morning television program Vida TV, in full wrestling gear and persona, billed as Abismo Negro. He usually appeared as a kind of judge for talent contests on the show earning him the nickname Fiscal De Hierro de la Televisi\u00f3n (the Iron Judge of Television). Palomeque owned and operated \"Gimnasio Abismo Negro\" where he taught both professional wrestling and physical fitness. Graduates of Abismo Negro's wrestling school include Independent wrestling workers El Intocable, Extassis and Mini Cibern\u00e9tico as well as AAA workers Sexy Star and Aero Star. Abismo Negro is a playable character in AAA's first ever video game, AAA El Videojuego. The Abismo Negro character was one of the first characters used to promote the game and show the quality of the graphic rendering. Death Palomeque was found dead on March 22, 2009. His body was found in a river near the town of El Rosario, Sinaloa. According to a bus driver who was transporting Palomeque and other passengers to Mexico City on Friday night March 20, Palomeque became agitated, panicked and demanded to be let off the bus despite it being 1:30 in the morning. A text message he sent to his wife after leaving the bus confirms that Palomeque found himself lost on the dark hillside. After receiving the text message, his wife contacted local wrestling promoter Vicente Martinez, who organized a search party. On the morning of March 22, Palomeque was found floating face down in the river. Afterwards, medical expert Jes\u00fas Enrique Castro L\u00f3pez stated that such an anxiety attack could be steroid related, but Palomeque's alleged steroid abuse has not been confirmed. An autopsy was carried out on March 23, which determined that the cause of death was drowning, and no further investigation into the death is planned. A memorial was held in Mexico City on March 24 for friends and family of Palomeque, many of whom showed up without their masks on, to keep the focus of the event on Palomeque. His body was subsequently cremated, with the ashes taken to Villahermosa to be buried.On Saturday March 21, while Palomeque was either lost in the hills or already dead, someone worked as Abismo Negro on an AAA show in Cancun. In the past, the wrestler known as Black Abyss had worked as Abismo Negro when Palomeque failed to show, but this time Black Abyss was not the man behind the mask, as he was on the opposing team that night. Following the discovery of Palomeque's body, the deception in Cancun received national coverage in Mexico and the local promoter responsible for the show, Ren\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, was suspended for two years by the Benito J\u00faarez Boxing and Wrestling commission.On October 26, 2009 AAA held the Torneo Abismo Negro in honor of Palomeque, the tournament was a 7-man gauntlet-style match and included a mix of five AAA veterans and two Abismo Negro students. The participants were Cuervo, Black Abyss, Gato Eveready, Kempo Dragon, Joe L\u00edder, Extreme Tiger and Rel\u00e1mpago. Rel\u00e1mpago, Abismo Negro's last student to turn professional, won the match after 48 minutes. The event was not televised and did not become an annual event. During Triplemania XVII there was a moment of silence in memory of Abismo Negro, Antonio Pe\u00f1a and Mitsuharu Misawa (Misawa had died the night before).

Career Early years Born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Raymond is a 1991 graduate of The Academy of Notre Dame de Namur, a private Catholic girls school in Villanova, Pennsylvania. She received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where she played for coach Andy Brandi's Florida Gators women's tennis team. As a Gator, she won the NCAA singles title in 1992 and 1993 and led the Gators to their first NCAA national team championship in 1992. She was the first player to win all three collegiate Grand Slam titles in a single season (1992). She received the 1992 Rookie of the Year award, the 1992 Tennis Magazine Collegiate Player of the Year award, and twice received the Honda Sports Award for Tennis, recognizing her as the outstanding collegiate female tennis player of the year in 1991\/92 and in 1992\/93.As a junior, Raymond won five U.S. National (USTA) singles and doubles titles, and she was ranked No. 1 in the U.S. for players 18-and Under in 1990. She was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great\" in 2003. 2005\u20132007 Played the first half of the year with Rennae Stubbs before beginning a partnership with Samantha Stosur, winning the US Open, her second doubles crown at Flushing Meadows, and the season-ending championships, also her second. Raymond and Stosur won six titles together and were named ITF World Doubles Champions of 2005.In 2006, Raymond and Stosur won ten titles including the French Open and their second season-ending championships. By winning the French Open, Lisa Raymond became only the 13th person in history to have won all four doubles Grand Slam tournaments. They finished the year as the co-holders of the number-one spot, and won a WTA-leading ten titles. Raymond and Stosur were again awarded by the ITF as World Doubles Champions of 2006. They also received the WTA Team of the Year award for their achievements.The year 2007 was a good one for Raymond and Stosur, with the pair winning five titles; also that year, Lisa decided to retire from her singles career. However, Stosur was diagnosed with a virus, forcing her to miss the second half of the season meaning Raymond had to play with various partners. Even though they only played half the season together, they had still qualified for the season-ending championships but could not compete. 2008\u20132009 Raymond began 2008 playing with Elena Likhovtseva with solid results but was cut short due to injury but then reunited with former partner Sam Stosur in May, after the latter's return from injury. They went on to reach the finals of Wimbledon and the US Open, losing both. Raymond also won titles in Memphis and New Haven. In 2009, Raymond began a partnership with Kv\u011bta Peschke, where they reached four finals and two semifinals before their year was cut short by an injury to Peschke, just before Wimbledon. Lisa played with different partners, winning one title, taking her tally to 68. Raymond now considers her 2008\u20132009 seasons to be almost 'lost' due to a lack of drive in her fitness. 2010 Raymond started the year by reuniting with former partner Rennae Stubbs. They lost their first round in Sydney, before reaching the semi-finals of the Australian Open, as the No. 6 seeds, losing to Venus and Serena Williams. Raymond also made the semifinals of the mixed-doubles tournament. Raymond and Stubbs won the Eastbourne International against Kv\u011bta Peschke and Katarina Srebotnik in the final, 6\u20132, 2\u20136 [13\u201311]. Both Raymond and Stubbs qualified for the WTA Tour Championships at Doha to face second seeds Peschke and Srebotnik. 2011 Raymond started the year by teaming up with Julia G\u00f6rges but in April started a new partnership with Liezel Huber. Starting slowly, by May their results picked up with a quarterfinal showing in Warsaw, semifinals at Roland Garros and Birmingham, runners-up in Eastbourne and Stanford. They were also quarter-finalists at Wimbledon and Cincinnati. They won their first tournament in Toronto and then claimed the US Open and Tokyo, with a semifinal finish in Beijing which qualified them for the WTA Championships in Istanbul. Both have stated they want to continue their partnership in 2012 and hopefully play the London Olympics. Raymond has now won six women's Grand Slam doubles titles, three at the US Open, bringing her grand total to nine (three in mixed) and 73 doubles titles in total. 2012 In Raymond's first tournament of the year at Sydney, she and her partner Huber were second seeds, and got to the final. The final against top seeds Peschke and Srebotnik was very close with the first two sets shared. In the deciding third set, the top seeds won 13\u201311. In the Australian Open, Raymond and Huber got to the quarterfinals without dropping a set but narrowly lost their quarterfinal match to Mirza and Vesnina in the deciding third-set tiebreaker. Raymond and Huber won the next four tournaments which were in Paris, Doha, Dubai and Indian Wells. In Paris, they were the top seeds. Gr\u00f6nefeld and Marti\u0107 were beaten in the final, in straight sets. In Doha, Raymond and Huber defeated Kops and Spears, in straight sets. In Dubai, they got revenge for their Australian Open defeat to Mirza and Vesnina by beating them in straight sets. At Indian Wells, Raymond and Huber beat Mirza and Vesnina in straight sets. At Wimbledon, as the No. 1 seeds, they lost to eventual champions, Serena and Venus Williams. Raymond's last tournament of the year was the Masters Cup. Her partner in the doubles was Huber. They got to the semifinals losing to Andrea Hlav\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 and Lucie Hradeck\u00e1, in straight sets. 2013 Raymond started the year ranked No. 6 in doubles. Her first tournament was with partner Maria Kirilenko in Sydney, where they were seeded third. They beat Marina Erakovic and Ekaterina Makarova in straight sets in the first round, but then lost in straight sets to Darija Jurak and Katalin Marosi. Next, Raymond and Kirilenko played at the Australian Open, where they were seeded No. 3. They were beaten in straight sets in the second round by the Australian duo of 16-year-old Ashleigh Barty (who was playing with a wildcard) and Casey Dellacqua, who later went on to reach the final. After the Australian Open, she dropped to No. 7, being overtaken in the rankings by her partner Maria Kirilenko. In February, Raymond teamed up with Sam Stosur to play at the Doha tournament, where they were unseeded and beat eighth seeds Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Sania Mirza in straight sets, then beat Janette Hus\u00e1rov\u00e1 and Zhang Shuai 2-1 sets, but lost in the quarterfinals against third seeded Raquel Kops-Jones and Abigail Spears, in straight sets. Next, in March, Raymond played in Miami, where she teamed up with British teenager Laura Robson (who was playing with a wildcard). They reached the semifinals, where they beat 1st seeds and world No. 1 pair, Errani and Vinci, in straight sets with the loss of just three games, but then lost in straight sets against third seeds Nadia Petrova and Katarina Srebotnik in the final. This partnership continued into the 2013 Wimbledon tournament. 2014 Raymond started the year ranked 42 in doubles. She reached the final of her first tournament of the year, Hobart, with Zhang Shuai as her partner. They narrowly lost to Monica Niculescu and Clara Zakopalov\u00e1. In the Australian Open, she partnered with Hantuchov\u00e1. They reached the third round and got knocked out by Makarova and Vesnina. At Nuremberg, she got as far as semifinal with Huber as her partner. The same pair lost to eventual French Open champions Hsieh and Peng in the third round. At Wimbledon, Raymond and Huber were seeded 15th but lost in the second round. In the US Open, Raymond teamed up with King, and they got to the third round before losing to the eventual tournament winners, Makarova and Vesnina. Raymond's best result in the mixed doubles was a second-round exit at the Australian Open with Mariusz Fyrstenberg from Poland as her partner. In the French Open and US Open, she lost in the first round with Peers and Lipsky, respectively.

Biography Mochtar was born in Cianjur, West Java, Dutch East Indies, on 1 July 1918. He dropped out of school in the first year of Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (junior high school). Sometime afterwards he was signed by the theatre company Miss Riboet's Orion for their football team; he had been a fan of the game since his youth. Mochtar was later asked to perform on stage. By the late 1930s he was skilled at the traditional martial art of silat.In 1939 Mochtar met The Teng Chun, owner and director of Java Industrial Film (JIF), while at a barbershop. Mochtar was signed to play opposite Hadidjah in JIF's upcoming film, Alang-Alang, as two lovers who confront bandits in a jungle. The Teng Chun intended Mohamad Mochtar and Hadidjah to become competitors to Roekiah and Rd Mochtar, who had become a popular on-screen couple owing to their success in Terang Boelan (1937) and Fatima (1938). Alang-Alang was successful, and Mohamad Mochtar was dubbed the \"Tarzan of Java\".This success led Hadidjah and Mochtar to be cast in romantic roles together for another five films for JIF. In 1940, Mochtar appeared in Matjan Berbisik (Whispering Tiger) as a man who fights his brother for the love of a young woman, then in Rentjong Atjeh (Rencong of Aceh) as a young man who fights pirates. In 1941 the pair appeared in another three films: Srigala Item (Black Wolf), Si Gomar, and Singa Laoet. Aside from his roles with Hadidjah, Mochtar also acted in several films for Action Films, a subsidiary of JIF, including Srigala Item and Tengkorak Hidoep (both 1941). Through these films Mochtar became one of the most famous actors in the Indies, recognised for his speed and courage. He did his own stunts \u2014 including scenes such as jumping from a moving motorcycle to a truck.In March 1942, the Japanese occupied the Indies and closed all but one film studio, including JIF. Mochtar became a Heiho, a native soldier for the Japanese forces, and took up roles in propaganda films such as Berdjoang (1943). Indonesia proclaimed its independence on 17 August 1945, and for two years no fiction films were produced in the area. Mochtar made his first film after the proclamation, Bengawan Solo, in 1949.Through the 1950s Mochtar acted in various films, and worked as cinematographer on two. He left the industry in 1957. He attempted to work at a shoe factory, then tried to open his own hotel and restaurant. In 1967 he returned to film, acting in Menjusurui Djedjak Berdarah; this role garnered him a Citra Award for Best Supporting Actor at the 1967 Indonesian Film Festival. After his return to film Mochtar focused primarily on supporting roles, only taking two further lead roles: in Lampu Merah (1971) and Gara Gara (1973). At the 1979 Indonesian Film Festival he received a special award, the Pikiran Rakyat Trophy, for his lengthy career. Mochtar died in Jakarta on 1 December 1981. Filmography During his 42-year career, Mochtar appeared in some 63 films. He also handled cinematography on 2 films.

Family background and personal life Born on 11 January 1903 in Berea, Durban, Colony of Natal, Siedle was the youngest son of Otto Siedle, who was born in Woolwich, London of southern German stock and who trained as a watchmaker, subsequently emigrating to Durban where he became prominent in the shipping business and public affairs. Otto Siedle's wife Mary became deputy mayor of Durban. Jack's older brother Karl Siedle played first-class cricket for Natal before the First World War, in which he was killed; his sister Perla Siedle Gibson became a well-known singer and a symbol of her country during the Second World War. Siedle married Lesley Maud McPherson on 14 March 1931, with his cricket colleague Eric Dalton as best man. Their son, John Siedle (1932\u20132008), played a few first-class cricket matches for Natal and Western Province in the mid-1950s. Early cricket career A right-hander who played for Natal for 15 seasons from 1922\u201323 to 1936\u201337, Jack Siedle bowled occasionally and kept wicket just as infrequently, but his chief value to South Africa was as an opening batsman. He had had no great success when he was picked, in the 1923\u201324 season, for the match that was the trial for the 1924 tour to England and the 56 he scored in his second innings there was his highest score to that point, as well as the top score for his side, but he was not picked for the tour. For the next couple of seasons that decision was made to look wise as Siedle struggled for runs in the Natal side, not improving his highest score and averaging little over 20 runs per innings. But in the first match of the 1926\u201327 season for Natal against Border he hit his first century, 114. Two matches on, he did better, sharing a partnership of 424 for the first wicket with John Nicolson against Orange Free State which remains the record for the first wicket for Natal and was the record for the whole of first-class cricket in South Africa until January 2020; Nicolson made an unbeaten 252 but Siedle's dismissal for 174 broke the partnership.Siedle was in less good form the following year, though he managed a second century against Orange Free State. He was then called up for the third Test at Durban against the touring England team, opening the innings and scoring 11 and 10. That was not enough for him to retain his place for the remaining games of the series. First-class cricket in South Africa in 1928\u201329 was restricted to a series of matches around Christmas in Durban, but Siedle took advantage of the match against a weak Border team to hit an unbeaten 212, his highest score to that point, and the innings secured his place on the 1929 tour to England. Test regular Siedle did well in the early first-class matches of the tour to England: in the second county match of the tour, he hit an unbeaten 169 against Leicestershire, taking more than five hours to reach 100 but then adding a further 69 in little more than an hour. Three weeks later he almost repeated the feat by making 168 against Yorkshire including 20 fours in what Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described as \"an admirable innings\". After that, however, he was forced to retire ill in the match against the Minor Counties and he then missed six of the next seven tour matches, and they included the first two Tests of the five-match series. He returned to fitness in time to be selected for the third Test, but he was not a success, being dismissed for 0 and 14 as England won the match by five wickets. There was no success for him in the remaining Tests in the series, either: he scored 6 and 1 in the fourth match and another 14 in a single innings in the final game. But away from the Tests, Siedle continued to be a regular and reliable scorer, though there were no more centuries. He ended the tour with 1579 runs, the second highest aggregate after Bruce Mitchell, at an average of 35.88, the second highest average after Herbie Taylor. His overall performance earned praise from Wisden: \"Siedle, though a failure in the three Test matches in which he took part, was very consistent otherwise and never looked an easy man of whom to dispose. He watched the ball well and had a nice variety of strokes,\" it wrote.Back in South Africa in the 1929\u201330 season, Siedle hit the highest score of his career in making an unbeaten 265 for Natal in the Currie Cup first-class match against Orange Free State. It was at that time and still remains the second highest innings for Natal, beaten only by Dave Nourse's 304 not out in 1919\u201320 against Transvaal.In 1930\u201331, England toured South Africa, and the Currie Cup was suspended. Siedle made 46 and 38 in Natal's match against the touring side, and that was enough to earn him a place in the team for the first of a five-Test series. The match was won by South Africa by the narrow margin of 28 runs and Siedle, with 13 and 35, had his best Test so far. The second Test was the sixth of Siedle's career and finally he was able to make runs: opening the batting with Bruce Mitchell, he scored 141 out of a first-wicket partnership of 260 that was the highest at the time for South Africa in Tests, and set the team on its way to its then-highest Test total, 513 for eight wickets declared. Mitchell and Herbie Taylor also scored centuries in the innings and England were forced to follow on, though the match ended as a draw. In the rain-hit third Test, Siedle made 38 in South Africa's first innings, surviving while four of his partners were out, but he was dismissed for 0 in the second innings. The fourth Test was a tight match that ended in a draw and Siedle scored 62 in the first innings and 8 in the second. And he made 57 and 30 in the final game of the series, also a draw, which left South Africa with a 1\u20130 series victory; in this match, with the game petering out to a draw, South Africa bowled its part-time bowlers, and Siedle took the only wicket of his entire first-class career, having the England batsman Maurice Turnbull caught and bowled. In the series as a whole, Siedle scored 384 runs at an average of 42.66; he was the second highest scorer for South Africa after Mitchell. Hiatus In 1931\u201332, South Africa toured Australia and New Zealand. Siedle was initially selected to be vice-captain to Jock Cameron on the tour. In the end, though, he did not go on the tour, and played very little domestic cricket that season in South Africa. He continued to appear fairly regularly for Natal in Currie Cup and other first-class games over the next seasons, but having missed the Australasian tour, there were no other opportunities for Test cricket until 1935, when he was selected against for the tour to England. Return to Test cricket Siedle was very much the form player in the first weeks of the South African tour of England in 1935. In May, he made centuries in three consecutive first-class matches, against Surrey, Oxford University and the MCC. In the Surrey game, Siedle was somewhat overshadowed by Dudley Nourse, who hit a century in each innings, but his unbeaten 104 in the second innings and an unbroken partnership of 160 with Nourse set up the declaration from which the South Africans achieved a decisive victory. Nourse was prominent with a first-innings century in the Oxford match as well, but in the second South African innings Siedle shared an opening stand of 164 with Herby Wade and then an unbroken partnership of 205 with Eric Rowan as a high-scoring match petered out to a draw: Siedle's 164 not out was his highest score of the tour. The match against MCC at Lord's was ruined as a contest by rain on the second and third days, but on the first day Siedle had carried his bat for 132 in the South Africans' innings of 297. Wisden reported that \"chief honours\" in the match went to Siedle and that his innings was \"a great feat in view of the previous poor scoring at headquarters\". It went on: \"Siedle, who batted for nearly five hours without giving anything approaching a chance, never took the slightest risk, but some of his off-side strokes and the square and late cuts were perfectly executed.\" Siedle did not keep up this rate of scoring and the three centuries in May were his only centuries of the tour, but he continued to make runs through June and was the first member of the touring team to reach 1,000 runs in the season.In the first Test at Nottingham, he top-scored in South Africa's first innings with 59, though he was quickly out for 2 when South Africa were forced to follow on; the first innings was played on a pitch made awkward by weekend rain and Wisden wrote that he played \"with commendable skill and steadiness for about three hours\" and \"afforded emphatic proof of his strength in defence\". But Siedle then had a poor match in the second game of the series, which took place at Lord's and which the South Africans won by 157 runs, their first victory in England ever and, as the only decisive result in the whole series, a series-winning victory; Siedle's contributions were 6 and 13. There were better scores of 33 and 21 in the third Test, which was drawn, but Siedle strained a knee in the match. The knee injury kept him away from cricket for three weeks and that included missing the fourth Test, but he was recovered in time for the final game of the series where he made innings of 35 and 36 in a high-scoring draw that confirmed the series win for South Africa. Injured again, he did not then play in any further first-class fixtures on the tour. His record in the Test series of 205 runs and a batting average of 25.62 put him well down the list of the South African batsmen: sixth in terms of aggregate and eighth in terms of average; on the tour as a whole, however, he made 1346 runs at an average of 39.58.The South African cricket season immediately following the England tour included a series of five Tests against the Australians, and although the series was won rather easily by Australia and there were many changes in the South African team, Siedle maintained his place in the Test side throughout the season. In the first match, he made 31 and 59, in both innings scoring much faster than his opening partner, Bruce Mitchell, but the match was lost by nine wickets. Innings of 22 and 34 followed in the next game which was drawn, largely through a huge score of 231 by Dudley Nourse. The third Test was a very heavy defeat for the South Africans and Siedle, with scores of 1 and 59, was the top-scorer for this side in the match. The following match was an even heavier defeat and a four-day match was over inside two days: Siedle again top-scored, making 44 in the first innings but 0 in the second. The batting overall was better in the fifth and final match of the series, though the result was still an innings defeat: Siedle scored 36 and 46 in this match; in contrast to his style earlier in the series, and in the second innings of this match, Siedle's first innings took more than two-and-a-half hours and his 36 was scored out of a total of 124. In the series as a whole, Siedle scored 332 runs at an average of 33.20 and was second only to Nourse both in aggregate and average.Siedle played only one further season of first-class cricket for Transvaal after this and had retired by the time of the next Test series played by the South African team. In the 1936\u201337 season, his last, he signed off with a score of 207 in his final first-class innings for Natal in the match against Western Province. He died on 24 August 1982 in Bulwer, Natal.

Early life Safire was born William Lewis Safir in New York City, the son of Ida (n\u00e9e Panish) and Oliver Craus Safir. His family was Jewish and of Romanian origin on his father's side. Safire later added the \"e\" to his surname for pronunciation reasons, although some of his relatives continued to use the original spelling.Safire graduated from the Bronx High School of Science, a specialized public high school in New York City. He attended S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University but dropped out after two years. He delivered the commencement address at Syracuse in 1978 and 1990, and became a trustee of the university. Career He was a public relations executive from 1955 to 1960. Previously, he had been a radio and television producer and an Army correspondent. He worked as a publicist for a homebuilder who exhibited a model home at an American trade fair at Sokolniki Park in Moscow in 1959\u2014the one in which Richard Nixon and Nikita Khrushchev had their Kitchen Debate. A much circulated black-and-white photograph of the event was taken by Safire. Safire joined Nixon's campaign for the 1960 presidential race, and again in 1968. After Nixon's 1968 victory, Safire served as a speechwriter for him and for Spiro Agnew; he is known for having created Agnew's famous term, \"nattering nabobs of negativism\". Safire prepared a speech called \"In Event of Moon Disaster\" for President Nixon to deliver on television if the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon. According to the plans, Mission Control would \"close down communications\" with the LEM and a clergyman would have commended their souls to \"the deepest of the deep\" in a public ritual likened to burial at sea. Presidential telephone calls to the astronauts' wives were also planned. The speech originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon's chief of staff H. R. Haldeman in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to Rupert Brooke's First World War poem \"The Soldier\". In a 2013 piece for Foreign Policy magazine, Joshua Keating included the speech as one of six entries in a list of \"The Greatest Doomsday Speeches Never Made\".He joined The New York Times as a political columnist in 1973. Soon after joining the Times, Safire learned that he had been the target of \"national security\" wiretaps authorized by Nixon, and, after observing that he had worked only on domestic matters, wrote with what he characterized as \"restrained fury\" that he had not worked for Nixon through a difficult decade \"to have him\u2014or some lizard-lidded paranoid acting without his approval\u2014eavesdropping on my conversations\".In 1978, Safire won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary on Bert Lance's alleged budgetary irregularities; in 1981, Lance was acquitted by a jury on all nine charges. Safire's column on October 27, 1980, entitled \"The Ayatollah Votes\", was quoted in a campaign ad for Ronald Reagan in that year's presidential election. Safire also frequently appeared on the NBC's Meet the Press. Upon announcing the retirement of Safire's political column in 2005, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The New York Times, said: The New York Times without Bill Safire is all but unimaginable, Bill's provocative and insightful commentary has held our readers captive since he first graced our Op-Ed Page in 1973. Reaching for his column became a critical and enjoyable part of the day for our readers across the country and around the world. Whether you agreed with him or not was never the point, his writing is delightful, informed and engaging. Safire served as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board from 1995 to 2004. After ending his op-ed column, he became the full-time chief executive of the Dana Foundation, where he was chairman from 2000. In 2006, Safire was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush. Portions of Safire's FBI file were released in 2010. The documents \"detail wiretapping ordered by the Nixon administration, including the tapping of Safire's phone\". Writing on English In addition to his political columns, Safire wrote a column, \"On Language\", in the weekly The New York Times Magazine from 1979 until the month of his death. Many of the columns were collected in books. According to the linguist Geoffrey Pullum, over the years Safire became less of a \"grammar-nitpicker,\" and Benjamin Zimmer cited Safire's willingness to learn from descriptive linguists. Another book on language was The New Language of Politics (1968), which developed into what Zimmer called Safire's \"magnum opus,\" Safire's Political Dictionary. Political views Safire described himself as a \"libertarian conservative\". A Washington Post story on the ending of his op-ed column quotes him on the subject: I'm willing to zap conservatives when they do things that are not libertarian. [After the 9\/11 attacks,] I was the first to really go after George W. on his treatment of prisoners. After voting for Bill Clinton in 1992, Safire became one of the leading critics of Clinton's administration. Hillary Clinton in particular was often the target of his ire. He caused controversy in a January 8, 1996, essay when, after reviewing her record, he concluded she was a \"congenital liar\". She did not respond to the specific instances cited, but said that she didn't feel offended for herself, but for her mother's sake. According to the president's press secretary at the time, Mike McCurry, \"the President, if he were not the President, would have delivered a more forceful response to that on the bridge of Mr. Safire's nose\".Safire was one of several voices who called for war with Iraq, and predicted a \"quick war\" and wrote: \"Iraqis, cheering their liberators, will lead the Arab world toward democracy.\" He consistently brought up the point in his Times columns that an Iraqi intelligence agent met with Mohamed Atta, one of the 9\/11 attackers, in Prague, which he called an \"undisputed fact\". According to the CIA and the FBI, they were unable to confirm or deny the validity of this assertion. The source who made these allegations is alleged to have become concerned that such a meeting could have harmed his career. Nonetheless, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh do deny that the meeting took place. Safire insisted that the theory was true and used it to make a case for war against Iraq. He also incorrectly predicted that \"freed scientists\" would lead coalition forces to \"caches [of weapons of mass destruction] no inspectors could find\".Safire was staunchly pro-Israel. He received the Guardian of Zion Award of Bar-Ilan University in 2005. President George W. Bush appointed him to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008. Death Safire died from pancreatic cancer at a hospice in Rockville, Maryland, on September 27, 2009, aged 79. He was survived by his wife, Helene Belmar (n\u00e9e Julius); their children, Mark and Annabel; and granddaughter, Lily.

A local doctor advised them that treatment was futile, but Walker helped her get admitted to Memorial Sloan\u2013Kettering.:\u200a129\u200a She lived another six months and died shortly before her fourth birthday. President Bush later wrote about his uncle: He was a great cancer surgeon, who had been stricken with polio. A strong and purposeful man. I told him of our local doc's advise and he said \"You have no choice - none at all - you must treat this child. You must do all you can to keep her alive\" and he went on to tell me of the strides in the field and of the importance of hope. So we treated her, and we watched her die before our eyes, but we also saw the wonders of remission and the dedication of the nurses and doctors, and we saw progress and we knew his advice was right. Six months later when it was all over - I thought back with gratitude for this sensible advice ... Walker had a second career as an investment banker. He became a managing partner in G. H. Walker & Co., founded by his father in 1900, and a limited partner in Alex. Brown & Sons. In 1971, he retired to a farm in Easton, Maryland which for two decades he ran profitably for a third career. He spent summers with his extended family in Kennebunkport, Maine. In 1989, President Bush appointed Walker's eldest son District Judge John M.

Burns was awarded an MBE in 2005 in recognition of her work representing transgender people. In 2011, she ranked 35th on the Independent on Sunday's annual Pink List of influential lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the United Kingdom.  Career Burns was born in the London Borough of Redbridge and attended the University of Manchester, earning first-class honors in computer science in 1975 and a master's degree in 1977. During her time as a city IT consultant and a Tory activist, she chose not reveal her trans history to colleagues. In 1995, Burns came out to local Tory leadership in order to campaign more openly. The British tabloids, however, chose to ignore her as she was \"too ordinary\". Remembering this era, she jokes about her changing perception of herself as a trans activist: \"I realised something had changed in 1997, when I realised it was more embarrassing to admit to being a conservative than to being a trans woman.\" Press for Change In 1992, Press for Change (PFC) was formed, and went on to become a key lobbying and legal support organisation for trans people in the UK.During 1992, Burns ran an IT consultancy business, \"Cheshire Computer Consultants\", and was Secretary of her local Conservative Party branch. Burns joined Press for Change in 1993, but only made her transgender background public in 1995. She was able to maintain her initial privacy as early PFC campaigns were paper based and, as such, fairly low key. She would go on to become a leading figure in obtaining legal recognition for trans people.Over the Christmas of 1995, she created the PFC web site as sub-pages within her own home page on Compuserve - one of the first serious campaign and information sites for minorities on the web. As editor of the site, she devised the now defunct PFC tagline \"Seeking no more but no less than what YOU take for granted\". In mid-1997, Burns and PFC's new webmistress, Claire McNab, registered the domain www.pfc.org.uk and moved the existing pages onto a commercial server. Representing PFC, Burns joined the Parliamentary Forum on Transsexualism shortly after it was set up in early 1995. She was also elected to sit on the policy governing council of the Human Rights NGO, Liberty. P vs S victory In 1996, PFC's legal work, led by Stephen Whittle, secured victory for the P vs S and Cornwall County Council case in the European Court of Justice (ECJ). It is the first piece of case law, anywhere in the world, which prevents discrimination in employment or vocational education because someone is trans.P had been the manager of an educational establishment, but was dismissed after she informed her employer that she intended to undergo gender reassignment. A subsequent industrial tribunal agreed that P was indeed dismissed due to her gender reassignment. The tribunal did not, however, believe that she had a remedy under the Sex Discrimination Act (SDA). At the time, the SDA prohibited adverse treatment for men and women because they belonged to one sex or the other.The tribunal asked the ECJ whether the Equal Treatment Directive - which states there should be \"no discrimination whatsoever on grounds of sex\" - applied where someone is changing or has changed their sex. In a landmark ruling, the ECJ made clear that changing sex is an aspect of sex: meaning dismissal related to gender reassignment is in breach of the Directive. As a member of the European Community, the UK is obliged to ensure UK law is always in accord with European Law (of which the Equal Treatment Directive is a part). When P's case returned to the tribunal, her discrimination complaint was upheld and she was financially compensated. The P vs S victory helped PFC gain support from journalists and led to the group's first face to face work with civil servants and ministers. Stephen Whittle provided legal analysis whilst Burns and Claire McNab pursued political areas of influence. The ECJ judgment was in April 1996, but it wasn't until early 1998 (following the change of government) that the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) decided to respond. The DfEE released a consultation on proposed legislation which asked, among other things, whether trans people should be allowed to work with children or vulnerable adults. Outraged, Burns urged PFC's followers to write to their MPs and also to Cherie Blair: a discrimination and public law specialist and wife to the then-Prime Minister, Tony Blair. More than 300 trans people and their supporters responded with a strong and unequivocal call to redraft the proposed legislation. As a consequence, Burns was invited to meet Margaret Hodge MP, the Minister for Education and Employment in the new Labour Government. Amid difficult, ongoing negotiations, Burns and PFC's Claire McNab pushed to keep the new employment regulations as open as possible. Assessing their success, Burns gave PFC \"seven out of ten\".To ensure that PFC campaigns remained focused and accountable, Burns wrote \"Five Principles\" for testing governmental action in May 1997 (right after the Labour Government came to power).Burns has criticised mental health practitioners for bias against trans people. She asserts that some psychiatrists refer for surgery only those patients whom they consider attractive, and she was an early critic of the controversial 2003 book The Man Who Would Be Queen by J. Michael Bailey. She has also criticised research claiming that trans people are less happy after transition. In addition, Burns has advocated on behalf of trans youth and their families seeking medical intervention as minors. Gender Recognition Act and MBE Burn was one of PFC's principal negotiators with Ministers and Civil Servants during the drafting of, and tabling and debating, the Gender Recognition Bill.She co-wrote PFC's 1999 submission to the Interdepartmental Working Group on Transsexualism set up by Jack Straw. The Working Group investigated the problems experienced by trans people in the UK and possible legislative solutions to them. The group disbanded after publishing a policy document in April 2000, a precursor to the Gender Recognition Bill. In a critique of the document, Burns wrote: \"The report's authors, and the ministers approving the report for publication, also seem to have given us a tremendous amount of rope with which to hang the government and force it now to the final act in this saga of over thirty years\". For 2 years, the government took the issue no further. Then, in a judgment delivered at Strasbourg on 11 July 2002 in the case of Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights held unanimously that: there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of the European Convention on Human Rights; there had been a violation of Article 12 (right to marry and to found a family)Following the ruling, the Home Office worked with PFC to develop the principles which would come to underpin the Gender Recognition Bill. Burns describes long hours \"drafting and agreeing complex submissions within punishing deadlines that civil servants themselves would never put up with.\" Consequently, PFC had considerable input into what proved to be a crucial turning point in the battle for legal recognition of trans people. According to the Telegraph, ministers privately feared that the legal reforms would create a public outcry \"similar to that caused by the repeal of Section 28\".Making use of the bill she had campaigned for, Burns was among the first to gain a certificate recognising her gender under the Gender Recognition Act 2004. She said: \"For most it's been a profoundly personal thing - not something to shout about, but a piece of paper to hold, to have a little cry, and feel closure at last.\" Burns was honoured with an MBE the same year as Stephen Whittle for her efforts on behalf of trans people. Her lobbying was lauded by MP Gerald Kaufman, who described her as \"brave and tenacious\".In 2007, she told the BBC about the rights which she helped win for trans people: \"Back in 1992, when Press For Change was started, [trans people] had no employment rights, they couldn't marry, they had no right to privacy and all of those things have been achieved by changes in the law ... I'm a transsexual woman, I'm now regarded as being a woman in the eyes of the law, it means that affects my retirement age, it means that I can marry a man and it also provides me with considerable protection of my privacy. So, for instance, if I disclose my transsexual background to someone in an official capacity and that person then goes off and blabs to somebody else - then that's a criminal offence.\" Political work and departure from PFC In 2005, Burns began to focus on the media and healthcare. She left PFC in November 2007 to pursue strategic issues with public officials and to mentor younger activists. NHS and international health advisor The Department of Health set up a Sexual Orientation Advisory Group (SOAG) in 2004. After lobbying from Press for Change, the Department of Health changed the name to the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Advisory Group (SOGIAG) to be more inclusive of trans needs and identities. Burns was invited to chair the transgender workstream of SOGIAG in 2005. As chair, she saw the need for research and official literature supportive of treatment and setting standards so, in 2006, she commissioned nine publications \u2013 ranging from guidance for GPs to advice for young people. Following this, the Department of Health commissioned her directly to write a resource for NHS managers and policymakers called \"Trans: A Practical Guide for the NHS\".During her time as Chair (July 2006 - May 2010) Burns invited Charing Cross Gender Identity Clinic into discussions at SOGIAG and at the Parliamentary Forum on Transsexualism. In 2009, she interviewed Stuart Lorimer, a clinician at London's Charing Cross Gender Identity Clinic. The same year she was formally appointed to the Department of Health's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Advisory Group.In 2005, the North West public sector agencies, led by the Northwest Development Agency and Northwest Regional Assembly, began preparing a regional equality and diversity strategy. Burns became involved via a public engagement panel, which went on to become the North West Equality and Diversity Group (NWEDG). As NWEDG's chair, Burns also sat on the North West's Equality Strategy Group (ESG). Through NWEDG and ESG, she helped set up an annual regional celebration of diversity called \"Celebr8, Don't Discrimin8\". The campaign included a series of short films, some of which are available on YouTube.She was invited to consult on a number of projects for NHS Northwest, including research and analysis leading to the publication of \"A Landscape of the Region\", (which she wrote for the SHA). She subsequently became the programme manager for the health authority's Equality and Diversity team in 2009. She has worked on a series of resources for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people including an LGBT history timeline, monitoring guidelines and a GP benchmarking tool, Pride in Practice. On the importance of the LGBT timeline, Christine said: \"Knowing our histories might just make life a bit easier for our communities to have role models and assure our place in organisations like the NHS.\" She was also directly involved in the creation of the first performance management framework for equality outcomes in the NHS, the Equality Performance Improvement Toolkit (EPIT) and the NHS's competency framework for leadership of equality and diversity. The UK LGBT Health Summits The first UK LGBT Health Summit was held in London in 2006 with over 160 healthcare professionals, voluntary and statutory sector professionals, activists, community organisers and grass roots campaigners. The LGBT Health Summit grew out of SOGIAG's work with the Department of Health and Burns, among others, secured proper trans involvement from the start. She was co-chair of the LGBT Health Summit 2010, and produced a mini documentary for the occasion.Her recognised leadership and knowledge of trans people in healthcare was recognised by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which invited Burns to be the British representative on its international advisory panel. The panel had influence over the Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People's seventh edition. It also made advisory input to the submissions WPATH have made to the International Classification of Diseases revision process in the World Health Organisation. Media reform Burns has advocated for better media depiction of trans people, including Hayley Cropper on Coronation Street and Nadia Almada on Big Brother. In December 1998, Julie Hesmondhlagh, the actress who plays Hayley, agreed to become Press for Change's official patron.Under Burns' leadership, PFC developed professional relationships with journalists, filmmakers and regulatory bodies and responded to offensive news items \"responsibly and constructively\". In later years, she became increasingly involved in behind the scenes work: appearing on television and radio as a campaign spokesperson and consulting at production level.She also supported people who were dealing with the media, including Councillor Ros Mitchell, who transitioned whilst sitting on Bristol's County Council. Mitchell faced unwanted press intrusion from her local newspaper in addition to criticism from the Guardian. During the spring of 1998, Burns collaborated in a BBC Home Ground programme (made by BBC Bristol) which documented Mitchell's transition. Writing on the PFC website, Burns claimed that an angry Labour Councillor threatened a BBC Politics correspondent with physical violence during production.In 1999, Sergeant Major Joanne Rushton revealed her intention to transition from male to female \u2013 prompting Britain's Ministry of Defence to announce that transgender people would be allowed to serve in the Armed Forces. Burns welcomed the news, but expressed concern about the Army's possible reaction to Sergeant Major Rushton entering into a relationship: \"Joanne will physically be a woman but legally be a man ... Given the Army's ban on homosexuality, it is not clear whether she will be allowed to have sexual relations with a man or a woman - if anyone.\"In 2004, she responded to the BBC's coverage of murdered trans man Brandon Teena with a campaign to change editorial guidelines around gendered pronouns. Burns brought Tim Toulmin before the Parliamentary Forum shortly before he was promoted to the head of the Press Complaints Commission. She also researched and produced the PFC report \"Transsexual People and the Press\", which led the Press Complaints Commission to change its Editors' Code of Practice. Following the media frenzy around Thomas Beatie's pregnancy in 2008, Burns defended the right of trans men to bear children: \"That's like saying you can't be a woman and have a career ... The irony is we've had a debate in feminism about the idea that if men were able to have children we would be in a very different position and yet when it happens there is enormous fear.\" LGBT History Month and public speaking In 2005 Burns became involved in supporting LGBT History Month and contributed profiles on Mark Rees and Stephen Whittle to the charity's website. She also produced a lesson plan on gender variance. She has recounted key moments in her work as a trans activist on the site, including PFC's trip to Downing Street and Alex Carlile's private member's bill proposing means to correct transgender people's birth certificates and status in the mid-1990s. Burns was invited to become a Patron of LGBT History Month in 2010, making her the educational campaign's first trans patron.Burns spoke at a conference on trans issues organised by the University of East Anglia in 2007. In 2008, she was a keynote speaker at a conference held by the Trans Resource and Empowerment Centre and the Centre for Local Policy Studies. At the Commission for Social Care Inspection conference in 2007 she explained that trans service users, relatives, professional stakeholders and care staff are often vulnerable and require protection from abuse.Burns introduced podcasts to the PFC web site when the term was largely unheard of, and continued to broadcast on the site til her departure in 2007. In 2008 she presented the first season of Just Plain Sense, her personal podcasts detailing a variety of equality and diversity topics from contemporary Britain. One of her earliest guests was Lynne Jones MP, the original chair of the Parliamentary Forum on Transsexualism in the 1990s. Pink list recognition Burns appeared at 96 on Time Out magazine's Pride Power List 2011 \u2013 a compilation of influential lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. She was the only trans person on the list and was placed between singer George Michael and pantomime dame Christopher Biggins. In her blog, Burns responded by critiquing such lists as subjective and divisive. Nevertheless, the following year the Independent on Sunday positioned her as the second highest ranking trans person on its annual Pink List.

Early life and Revolutionary Wars A nobleman by birth, Saint-Sulpice joins the army as a sublieutenant in 1777, becoming a lieutenant-colonel in 1792 in the Army of the Alps. He is then suspended, from September 1793 to May 1795, because of his aristocratic ascendance. Despite the proclamation of the French Consulate, the career of Saint-Sulpice seems to stagnate until 1803, when he is finally promoted to brigadier general. With the proclamation of the Empire, Saint-Sulpice gets a position as \u00c9cuyer cavalcadour of the Empress Jos\u00e9phine. Napoleonic Wars and Bourbon Restoration With the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars, Saint-Sulpice is given the command of a cuirassier brigade in d'Hautpoul's 2nd heavy cavalry division of the cavalry reserve of the Grande Arm\u00e9e, which he will command between 1805 and 1807. At the battle of Eylau in 1807 Saint-Sulpice is wounded, but a week later, on the 14 of February, he gets promoted to general of division and takes command of the 2nd heavy cavalry division, replacing d'Hautpoul, who had died of his injuries. Named count of the Empire in 1808, he fights in most of the major engagements of the Fifth Coalition in 1809: Abensberg, Eckm\u00fchl, Ratisbon, Aspern-Essling and Wagram. During the French invasion of Russia, Saint-Sulpice is given command of the dragoon regiment of the Guard. The next year, in March 1813, he is named governor of the castle of Fontainebleau but then is called to serve in the Grande Arm\u00e9e again for the War of the Sixth Coalition, fighting in Saxony. In 1814, as the fighting continued, this time on French soil, Saint-Sulpice is assigned to serve under Marshal of the Empire Pierre Augereau, whose orders were to defend Lyon against the invading Allied armies. Retiring from active service, he became a Peer of France in 1831. His name appears on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

In 2014, a blog post by Quinn's ex-boyfriend sparked the Gamergate controversy, in which Quinn was subjected to extensive harassment. The next year, Quinn co-founded Crash Override, a crisis hotline and resource center for victims of online harassment.  Early life Zo\u00eb Tiberius Quinn was born in 1987 and was raised in a small town near the Adirondack Mountains in New York. Growing up, Quinn's favorite video game was Commander Keen, an MS-DOS game featuring an eight-year-old protagonist who builds a spaceship with items found around his house and then travels the galaxy defending the Earth. Quinn suffered from depression as a teenager, having been diagnosed with the condition at age 14. They described receiving little sympathy or assistance from school district officials who were \"less than understanding about teens with depression and suicide issues\". Career At the age of 24, Quinn moved to Canada and made their first foray into video game programming. Quinn's first game was the result of a six-week course on video game creation that they attended after seeing an advertisement in a newspaper. In a later interview for The New Yorker, Quinn said, \"I felt like I'd found my calling.\" Depression Quest One of Quinn's earliest creative works, Depression Quest, was conceived as a \"choose-your-own path\" adventure detailing the troubled life of a person suffering from depression, with many of the \"correct\" paths blocked due to the protagonist's struggle with mental self-care. Quinn thought this sort of game narrative would be a good way to depict depression, imposing a set of rules on players that might not experience such problems in their day-to-day lives. Depression Quest was released in February 2013.Quinn attempted to publish the game on Steam Greenlight service twice \u2013 in December 2013 and later in August 2014, when it was accepted and released by Steam. Depression Quest was featured in a Playboy article as one of several video games dealing with the subjective experience of depression. Other projects Quinn created the Game Developer Help List, designed to bring experienced game developers and novice developers into contact with one another. In 2014, Quinn intended to be part of the canceled YouTube reality television show codenamed \"Game_Jam\", which was meant to bring together a number of prominent indie game developers.In 2015, Quinn served as a narrative design consultant for Loveshack Entertainment's iOS game Framed. As of 2014, Quinn was also working on a full motion video game starring Greg Sestero.In 2015, Quinn wrote a chapter for Videogames for Humans, a book about games made using the Twine tool. Quinn also contributed a chapter to the book The State of Play: Sixteen Voices on Video Games, detailing their experiences making Depression Quest and the subsequent harassment they faced. In 2015, Quinn appeared in the documentary GTFO. They also wrote a scenario for \"Widow's Walk\", an expansion for Betrayal at House on the Hill, released in 2016.In September 2016, Quinn was reported to be working with erotica author Chuck Tingle on a full motion dating sim under the working title \"Project Tingler\". The game was finally named \"Kickstarted in the Butt: A Chuck Tingle Digital Adventure\" and a Kickstarter campaign was started in October 2016 asking for $69,420 to fund the project. The game raised over $85,000 from 2,450 backers weeks later. In January 2018, Quinn's role as Narrative Designer at Heart Machine's upcoming game Solar Ash Kingdom was also announced.In June 2018, Quinn's career as a comics writer started with the announcement of their work with illustrator Robbi Rodriguez on DC Vertigo's Goddess Mode, which became one of the last comics released under the Vertigo label. In July 2019, their participation in the upcoming issues of IDW Publishing's The Addams Family: The Bodies Issue and Marvel's Fearless was announced.Quinn has additionally worked on Fez, Jazzpunk, and They Bleed Pixels.Quinn is interested in human enhancement and has implanted an NTAG216 NFC chip in the back of their hand that can be programmed to perform various functions. Their first use of the chip was to load it with the download code for the game Deus Ex. Quinn also has a magnetic implant in their left ring finger. Harassment and Gamergate Quinn has faced harassment in response to Depression Quest since the game's initial release. This intensified with the additional publicity the game received on Steam. Quinn initially withdrew the game from Steam's Greenlight service, after having a detailed rape threat mailed to their home address. When they brought Depression Quest back to Greenlight, Quinn began receiving threatening phone calls.In August 2014, Eron Gjoni, a former boyfriend of Quinn, posted a lengthy blog post detailing his relationship with them. Based on the contents of the post, Quinn was falsely accused of receiving positive coverage from a journalist with whom they were in a relationship. (It was later shown that the journalist, Nathan Grayson, had only written about Quinn once, before they started a relationship). These accusations sparked the harassment campaign known as Gamergate. Quinn suffered extensive harassment including doxing, rape threats, and death threats. Media coverage of Gamergate resulted in widespread recognition of sexism in gaming.According to The New Yorker, the harassment escalated to the point where Quinn left their home and began working with the authorities to identify those responsible for the harassment. Quinn detailed the experience in an interview on MSNBC's Ronan Farrow Daily, saying that Gamergate represented a rapidly shrinking fringe among an increasingly diverse gaming community, and that those attacking Quinn and women in gaming needed \"to just grow up\". Speaking with BBC News, Quinn said the harassment had consumed their life, leading them to feel as if \"surrounded by nothing but hate \u2013 it's virulent, it's everywhere\" and that they were \"just trying to survive\". The attacks boiled down to \"the same accusation everybody makes toward every successful woman: she got to where she is because she had sex with someone\", and Quinn also pointed out that Gamergate had targeted \"the people with the least power in the industry\". \"[I] used to go to games events and feel like I was going home... Now it's just like... are any of the people I'm currently in the room with, the ones that said they wanted to beat me to death?\" Quinn said that their therapist remarked of the harassment, \"I don't even know what to tell you, this is so f-\u200d-\u200d-ing far outside anything I'm aware of.\"In January 2015, Quinn co-founded Crash Override, a private network of experts to assist victims of online harassment which in March 2015 joined forces with Randi Harper's Online Abuse Prevention Initiative. On September 24, 2015, Quinn spoke at the United Nations along with Anita Sarkeesian about online harassment. In their speech, Quinn spoke about the need for technology companies to provide proper moderation and terms of service which protect marginalized groups. Quinn also raised concerns about providing better protections for transgender women and victims of domestic violence on the Internet. Quinn identified as non-cisgender in January 2017, and their preferred pronouns are they\/them.In September 2017, Quinn published the memoir Crash Override: How Gamergate (Nearly) Destroyed My Life, and How We Can Win the Fight Against Online Hate. The book has received generally positive reviews, with critics praising what they described as Quinn's thoughtful, nuanced portrayal of Quinn's harassers, but lamenting the book's \"scattered\" narrative flow. The book was nominated for the 2018 Hugo Award for Best Related Work (i.e., non-fiction work related to science fiction or fantasy). Bibliography Quinn, Zo\u00eb (2017).

Alternative Press described Decapitated as remaining one of \"death metal's elite\" bands.  History Winds of Creation, Nihility and The Negation (1996\u20132004) Decapitated was founded in Krosno, Poland in 1996, by guitarist Wac\u0142aw \"Vogg\" Kie\u0142tyka, who was 15 at the time, his brother drummer Witold \"Vitek\" Kie\u0142tyka, who was 12 years old, and vocalist Wojciech \"Sauron\" W\u0105sowicz, who was 16. One year later, bassist Marcin \"Martin\" Rygiel, 13, joined the band. Decapitated released its first demo, Cemeterial Gardens, in 1997 and its second demo, The Eye of Horus, in 1998. After signing to Earache Records subsidiary Wicked World, the band released its debut album, Winds of Creation, which included a cover version of Slayer's \"Mandatory Suicide\", and was produced by Piotr Wiwczarek from the Polish band Vader, in April 2000. The band toured with Vader in early 2001 in the United Kingdom. Allmusic states that \"Decapitated have quickly gained recognition as one of Poland's, and even Europe's, finest exponents of ultra-technical death metal.\"Decapitated's self-produced second album, Nihility, which was released in February 2002, fulfilled the high expectations that followed the well-received debut album. Nihility also included a cover version of Napalm Death's \"Suffer the Children\". Decapitated was chosen to perform at the Polish Ozzfest event in late May and toured in North America and Europe in August. S\u0142awek and Wojtek Wies\u0142awscy produced the band's next album, The Negation, which was released in February 2004. The album received a positive response from critics and was followed by a tour in Europe and the United States throughout 2004. Organic Hallucinosis and hiatus (2005\u20132008) In mid-2005, Sauron announced his withdrawal from Decapitated, stating: \"It was not an easy decision. However, I could reconcile the welfare of the band with my personal plans, and hence quitting appeared to be the best solution not hampering the evolution of Decapitated.(...) Moreover, another reason that contributed to my decision have been some health complications.\" The band chose Adrian \"Covan\" Kowanek, a previous member of Atrophia Red Sun, as his replacement and entered Hertz Studios in Bia\u0142ystok in August to record their ambitious fourth album Organic Hallucinosis, which was released the following February. According to Allmusic, the band's musical change of direction on this album was \"likely to polarize longtime Decapitated fans\".During the following tour in December 2005, Marcin could not perform with the band due to military conscription issues and was shortly substituted by Richard Gulczynski, but joined again in February 2006. During the year, Decapitated toured with American bands Suffocation, Six Feet Under, Fear Factory, and others. In June and July 2007, Decapitated played with Cephalic Carnage and others in the Summer Slaughter trek across the US. Once the tour ended, Marcin departed from Decapitated to live with his family and to move to California.On October 28, 2007, the remaining three band members were involved in an automobile accident that injured Vitek and Covan. Their tour bus collided with a truck carrying wood in Gomel, near the border from Russia to Belarus. Vitek died on November 2, 2007 at the age of 23 in a Russian hospital from the injuries. Covan slipped into a coma and was later moved to Poland. In 2008, Metal Mind Productions released the concert DVD Human's Dust. Reformation and Carnival Is Forever (2009\u20132013) On March 8, 2009, after a period of disbandment, Vogg announced he was planning to continue the band and was searching for a new drummer and vocalist. Covan was unable to continue with Decapitated due to the slow improvement of his condition. In early 2009, Vogg participated on recording of the guitars for Vader's album Necropolis and continued with the band on a tour in support of the album, starting in September.In mid-2009 Vogg stated: \"It has been the hardest thing for me to move on without Vitek by my side, but he would have wanted me to continue with the band. Finally, I have found some great musicians who can continue the work of Vitek and Covan.\" \"There's no sense in stopping this amazing thing we built up so many years ago together with Vitek, Sauron, Martin and Covan.\"On July 31, 2009, the Austrian drummer Kerim \"Krimh\" Lechner of Thorns of Ivy joined Decapitated. On November 20, 2009, the new line-up was completed with the vocalist Rafa\u0142 Piotrowski of the band Ketha and bassist Filip \"Heinrich\" Ha\u0142ucha of Vesania and Masachist. Decapitated continued with support of Nuclear Blast record label and Hard Impact Music management. The band toured in United Kingdom in February 2010 as well as in April and May in Australia, New Zealand and European festivals and the Summer Slaughter tour in United States in mid-2010.The band entered RG Studio in Gda\u0144sk on February 9, to begin recording their fifth studio album entitled Carnival Is Forever. The album was produced by Vogg; while mixing and drums production was done by Swedish producer Daniel Bergstrand, who previously worked with Behemoth and Meshuggah among others. Heinrich departed from Decapitated after the recording in order to concentrate on Vesania, and Carnival Is Forever was released on July 12, 2011.On November 1, 2011, the band was on board LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16 when the crew were unable to extend the landing gear and were forced to land the aircraft on its belly. Everyone aboard the flight survived. Decapitated went on a European tour with Meshuggah in mid-2012. Lechner left the band in September 2012 and was replaced by former Vader drummer Pawe\u0142 Jaroszewicz. In late 2012, Decapitated played concerts in Nepal, Japan, and Thailand, among others. In 2013, the band joined Lamb of God on a tour in North America. Blood Mantra, Anticult and members' arrests (2014\u20132020) On March 13, 2014, the band announced the addition of drummer Micha\u0142 \u0141ysejko to its lineup, who had been touring with Decapitated since January 2014. Decapitated recorded Blood Mantra during March in Hertz Studio in Poland, and released the album in September. During a tour in United States in October, the band was involved in serious van accident on the way to a show in New Orleans, Louisiana. Nobody was seriously injured and the band continued on tour. Decapitated accompanied Soulfly on their 2015 We Sold Our Souls To Metal Tour.The album Anticult was released on July 7, 2017. Vogg stated about the songwriting process: \"[This] album is one that we created together as a band. Our drummer, Micha\u0142 [\u0141ysejko], [helped] a lot with the arrangements and the songs. He's like the co-author of the songs. It's like I used to do with Vitek [Witold Kie\u0142tyka].\"On 9 September 2017, all four members of Decapitated's line up at the time (Micha\u0142 \u0141ysejko, Wac\u0142aw \"Vogg\" Kie\u0142tyka, Rafa\u0142 Piotrowski and Hubert Wi\u0119cek) were arrested in Santa Ana, California after a show. Prior to the arrest, the band members had offered to surrender to the police as soon as they had learned of an investigation, but never heard anything back. After being extracted to Spokane, each band member was formally charged with rape in October 2017. Piotrowski and Kie\u0142tyka were both charged with second degree rape, while \u0141ysejko and Wi\u0119cek's charges were for third degree rape. All members of the band plead not guilty to their respective criminal charges. All charges were dropped by prosecutors in January 2018, citing the \"well-being of the victim\" and \"in the interest of justice\", and the scheduled trial later that month was cancelled. According to Piotrowski's attorney Jeffry Finer, the accuser was heavily involved in the decision to drop charges and the band's defence attorneys also highlighted testimonies from numerous concert attendees and musicians from other bands in support of the band's version of events. In March 2018, Kie\u0142tyka wrote a statement explicitly rejecting the accusations and describing the experience as \"one of the most terrible and irrational times in our lives\".In July 2018, the band released a music video for the song \"Kill The Cult\" from their 2017 album. In December 2018, the band announced departure of drummer \u0141ysejko.On September 28, 2019, Vogg was announced as Phil Demmel's replacement in Machine Head for a tour. Vogg revealed that Decapitated would begin writing new music in 2020 for their eighth studio album. In September 2020, Decapitated re-signed with Nuclear Blast and also announced former touring drummer James Stewart has become a full-time band member, while bassist Hubert Wi\u0119cek was no longer in the band. Cancer Culture (2021\u2013present) The band announced dates in July 2021 for their upcoming 2022 European tour to mark their 25th anniversary, with support from Black Tongue, Heart of a Coward and INFERI. Heart of a Coward later withdrew from the tour and were replaced with Archspire.On March 17, 2022, the band announced their new album Cancer Culture would be released on May 27, and also released the title track from the album. They also revealed the album would feature guest performances from members of Jinjer and Machine Head. The album and music videos feature the return of Pawe\u0142 Pasek on bass. Musical style and critical reception Decapitated's music is written by Vogg, who co-worked with Vitek while writing prior to his death. Decapitated became known for its songwriting and technical instrumental approach at an extraordinarily young age and earned an international fan base in the underground music community. In the review of Decapitated's debut album, Allmusic said \"the band has a seemingly effortless understanding and command of ... their instruments and ... the songwriting is extremely solid; even in the first listen.\" The characteristics of Nihility and Negation are \"powerful, blastbeat-filled drumming, dissonant yet memorable guitar riffs, and inventive guitar solos\" and substantially high production quality. In the review of The Negation, Metal Hammer states that \"Sauron is one of the most capable vocalists on the scene\". With Organic Halucinosis, Decapitated focused on non-traditional death metal aesthetics, more complex songwriting and grooves, and polyrhythmic approach; Covan contributed more versatile vocals. A notable element of groove is present in Decapitated's death metal sound, which has been often described as technical death metal. Vogg cited Dimebag Darrell of Pantera as an \"inspiration for making groovy riffs\". Recently, the band and their later musical output have been described as groove metal.Decapitated's releases are some of death metal's most significant albums of the early 21st century. Winds of Creation was \"responsible for re-igniting a stagnating death metal scene\" and Organic Hallucinosis proved to be substantially influential in the subsequent development of the genre. According to Kerrang!, Decapitated have released \"classic albums; (...) that have turned these youthful Poles into one of the genre's most widely respected bands. Tomas Haake, the drummer of the Swedish band Meshuggah, commented the death of Vitek: \"The metal community has lost one of the most talented and skillful drummers of our time! [...] Vitek was a true talent and drummer genius.\" In 2017, Alternative Press described Decapitated as one of \"death metal's elite\" bands.

From that point he received international attention, including 109th birthday greetings from Queen Elizabeth II, the Governor General of Canada and the Canadian Prime Minister, until his death on February 18, 2010.  Early life Babcock was born on July 23, 1900, into a family of thirteen children on a farm in Frontenac County, Ontario. According to Babcock, the barn where he was born (which no longer exists) was located off Highway 38 in South Frontenac Township. His father died in 1906 after a tree-cutting accident, when Babcock was only six years old. As described in his account given to Maclean's, while his father was cutting down one tree, another dead tree fell on his shoulder. Although he was brought into the house on bobsleigh, he only survived another two hours. Babcock said that this was an \"awful blow\" to the family.School was never a concern for Babcock, and he did not earn his high school diploma until the age of 95. On growing up in the area, Babcock claims that he \"didn't do very much,\" although he admits that \"[i]t was a fun place to grow up.\" Babcock partook in fishing, hunting, and swimming\u2014especially around the local Sydenham Lake\u2014in order to pass the time with the other kids his age. He would return to the area in 1919, after his wartime experiences, but soon after left for the United States. Nevertheless, Babcock's relatives continue to work at the Crater Dairy farm (named after the Holleford crater, a remnant of a meteor strike) and the community grew to greatly respect John. World War I At the age of fifteen and a half, Babcock was impressed at Perth Road by two recruiting officers, one a lieutenant and one a sergeant, who quoted from the poem \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\". He was also enticed by the offered salary, which was $1.10 per day, as opposed to the 50 cents he could have made through physical labour. Babcock was recruited in Sydenham, Ontario and joined the 146th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He was then sent to Valcartier, Quebec. There Babcock underwent a physical, where it was discovered that he was underage. He was designated status A-4: physically fit, but underage. At the time, the minimum age for combat was eighteen. Babcock was turned down, but managed to make it all the way to Halifax by train before he was stopped by the company commander.In Halifax he was sent to Wellington Barracks, the city's peacetime barracks, where he wrestled freight onto large army vehicles and dug ditches. Tired of the work, Babcock took the opportunity to volunteer for the Royal Canadian Regiment when fifty recruits were called on, claiming that his age was 18. Officials quickly discovered that he was only 16, however, and they placed him in a reserve battalion known as the Boys (or Young Soldiers) Battalion in August 1917. Babcock then undertook an ocean voyage to England and, in Liverpool, he was stationed with the 26th Reserve and sent to Bexhill-on-Sea where he trained with about 1,300 others, about a third of whom were veterans from battles in France.The Young Soldiers Battalion trained the recruits for eight hours a day. In his spare time Babcock went on leave to Scotland, where he met his first girlfriend, a woman from the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. He was also introduced to the pleasures of beer and the horrors of war that some of the older veterans had come across. Babcock asserts that he would have fought in the conflict, given the chance, but the war ended before he could be brought to the front lines. For this reason, Babcock claims that he never felt like \"a real soldier\" and rarely talked of his experiences until his centenary. He also never joined any veterans associations. Experiences Babcock's brother Manley enlisted after John and served with the Canadian Military Engineers as a sapper. Manley suffered a nervous breakdown after the war. This, in Babcock's eyes, was one of many psychological problems that occurred during and after the war. He recalled at least one instance where a soldier shot himself with a .45 after his comrades discovered that he had emigrated from Germany, while another ran himself through with a bayonet after a pack drill. Babcock also recounted the importance of honesty in the Canadian Army. In one case, one of his comrades stole a dollar watch and received nine months in prison and Babcock cited that as an example of the strict discipline in the military structure. By March 1918 he had been promoted to acting corporal, but was reduced to the rank of private for neglect of duty. By October of that year, however, he had been restored to acting lance corporal. Soldiers holding acting ranks in the Canadian forces receive the salary and allowances of the rank, but can be restored to a previous rank at any time due to their lack of the necessary training or experience to hold that position permanently. In Canada during wartime, individuals could be promoted to acting ranks in order to meet service requirements. After the First World War With relatives in the United States, Babcock paid the $7 head tax and moved there in 1921. He received a Canadian Army pension that totaled $750 shortly after the conflict and took advantage of veteran vocational training in his native country to become an electrician. He ran a small light plant in his home neighborhood of Sydenham, and later had a career as an industrial supply salesman in the United States.He became a United States citizen in 1946 after serving in the United States Army and achieving the rank of sergeant. In so doing, he lost his Canadian citizenship, as Canadian law prior to 1977 limited dual citizenship. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, he attempted to sign up for active duty with the army's flying service (the United States Air Force was not formed until 1947), but was turned down for being too old. He therefore spent World War II in the United States Army and among his duty stations was Fort Lewis, located in Tacoma, Washington.At the age of 65, Babcock became a pilot. As of 2006 he was in good mental and physical health, displayed by his ability to quickly recite the alphabet backwards, spell out his name in Morse Code, and take daily walks with his wife to keep in shape. At the age of 100 he wrote an autobiography titled Ten Decades of John Foster Babcock. It was distributed only to family and friends.Babcock was married twice, first to Elsie, then to Dorothy, a woman nearly thirty years his junior whom he met when she was taking care of his first wife while she was dying. Babcock had one son (Jack Jr.) and one daughter (Sandra). One grandchild, Matt, was an army dentist in Iraq during the Iraq War. John and Dorothy resided in Spokane, Washington, where Babcock lived from 1932 until his death. Babcock was not the only centenarian in his family; his younger sister Lucy died in July 2007 at the age of 102. Last surviving Canadian veteran From the death of Dwight Wilson on May 9, 2007, Babcock was the last known Canadian veteran of the First World War. He was proud of his status as the last surviving Canadian World War I veteran, although he did not feel the need to be honoured in a specific state funeral. Instead, he was of the opinion that \"they should commemorate all of them, instead of just one.\" He was also quoted as saying \"I'm sure that all the attention I'm getting isn't because of anything spectacular I've done. It's because I'm the last one.\"Nevertheless, Babcock received much attention on the occasion of his 107th birthday, with wishes from Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Canada (who Babcock joked is a \"nice looking gal\"), Governor General Micha\u00eblle Jean, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay. James Moore, a Member of Parliament from British Columbia, visited Babcock personally to deliver gifts and greetings. For his birthday, Babcock and his wife went to Rosauers for his favourite meal of hamburgers and French fries. Among the gifts he received was a necktie adorned with a poppy pattern, a symbol of the First World War. In his hometown of South Frontenac, mayor Gary Davison sent a letter of congratulations, while the local coffee shop named their local blend, \"The Jack,\" after him.Babcock was invited to the opening of a Pentagon exhibit on March 6, 2008, featuring photos of nine First World War veterans, but was unable to attend. At the time he was one of only two of the veterans pictured to be alive, along with American Frank Buckles, who did participate in the event. In 2008, he was visited by Canadian officials and wrote to Prime Minister Stephen Harper that he was interested in regaining his Canadian citizenship in a letter that was hand-delivered to him in a cabinet meeting. The request was approved by the Prime Minister and the paperwork was signed by Governor General Micha\u00eblle Jean, after which officials from Citizenship and Immigration Canada were flown to Spokane to complete the swearing in ceremony. That same year, Babcock participated in the Canadian Remembrance Day ceremonies, appearing via video to symbolically pass the torch of remembrance, urging people to \"hold it high\". Babcock credited his longevity to the intense physical training that he received in both the United States and Canadian armies.Babcock died on February 18, 2010, at the age of 109, having been housebound since October 2009 following a case of pneumonia. He was cremated and his remains were scattered across the Pacific Northwest. Governor General Jean and Prime Minister Harper made statements of condolence shortly after his death and, on the anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge (April 9), Canada's monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, issued a statement marking the two events, stating: \"As proud and grateful Canadians, we pause today to mark not only the ninety-third anniversary of this Nation's victory at Vimy Ridge but also to pay tribute to the passing of a truly remarkable generation who helped to end the most terrible conflict the world had ever known.\" The local Royal Canadian Legion in Sydenham, Ontario has a collection of First World War items on display, including a roll call with Babcock's name on it, in his honour.

He then went on to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's School of Architecture and Planning, where he received his M.Arch in Advanced Studies in the History and Theory of Architecture in 1979. His dissertation was entitled Reference, Coherence, Meaning: A Realist Epistemology of Art under the direction of Henry A. Millon. In 1990, he completed his Ph.D program at MIT School of Architecture and Planning in the History, Theory, and Criticism of Architecture and Art. His main focus of study was European Modernism and his minor field was critical theory. His dissertation was advised by Stanford Anderson and he wrote on Modernism and the Posthumanist Subject: The Architecture of Hannes Meyer and Ludwig Hilberseimer, which he later published into a book of the same title. Career Hays has played a central role in the development of architectural theory, which has gained him international renown. His research and scholarship have focused on the areas of European modernism and critical theory, as well as on theoretical issues of contemporary architectural practice. He has published on the work of modern architects such as Hannes Meyer, Ludwig Hilberseimer, and Mies van der Rohe, as well as on contemporary figures such as Peter Eisenman, Bernard Tschumi, and the late John Hejduk. Hays was the founder of the scholarly architecture journal Assemblage, which was a leading forum in discussion of architectural theory in both North America and Europe. From 1995 through 2005, he was Chair of the Ph.D. Committee and director of the Harvard Graduate School of Design's Advanced Independent Study Program. In 2000, he was appointed the first Adjunct Curator of Architecture at the Whitney Museum of American Art, a position he held until 2009.

He played collegiately at the University of Louisville.  He is widely regarded as one of the greatest college basketball players of all time.  High school and college Griffith starred at Louisville Male High School and was heavily recruited by colleges all across the country. In fact, Griffith reportedly turned down an offer to forego college and sign with the ABA's Kentucky Colonels. He decided to attend his hometown school, the University of Louisville, much to the delight of local fans. He didn't disappoint, delivering the school's first-ever NCAA men's basketball championship in 1980. He scored 23 points in the Cardinals' 59\u201354 victory over UCLA in the championship game. Due to his strong performance, he was named Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Griffith totaled 825 points in his senior season, setting a school record. For his efforts, he was named First Team All-American by the Associated Press and was given the Wooden Award as the best college basketball player in the nation. He left college as Louisville's all-time leading scorer with 2,333 points in his career. His jersey number, 35, was retired during ceremonies after the 1980 season. Professional career Utah selected Griffith with the second overall pick in the 1980 NBA draft. The Jazz had recently moved to Salt Lake City from New Orleans, and the team needed a star to replace legendary shooting guard Pete Maravich. Griffith accepted the challenge, averaging 20.6 points per game in his first season and earning the NBA's Rookie of the Year award.For the next four seasons, Griffith teamed with small forward Adrian Dantley to form one of the highest-scoring duos in the league. With defensive support from center Mark Eaton and point guard Rickey Green, the Jazz improved dramatically, winning the Midwest Division title in 1983\u201384 and qualifying for the NBA playoffs for the first time ever. Individually, Griffith transformed his offensive game, adding long-distance shooting skills to his aerial acrobatics. He led the league in three-point shooting (36.1 percent) and set an NBA record for most three-pointers made in a single season (91). His new abilities earned him a new nickname: Utah's play-by-play announcer Hot Rod Hundley began calling him \"The Golden Griff\". The following season (1984\u201385) was the best of Griffith's career. He averaged a career-high 22.6 points per game, and broke his own league record by sinking 92 three-point shots. During the year, he passed Joey Hassett as the all-time NBA leader for most career three-pointers. He also continued his high-flying ways, representing the Jazz in the 1984 and 1985 NBA Slam Dunk Contests.However, the team changed dramatically in the mid-1980s with the emergence of Karl Malone and John Stockton as Utah's top offensive weapons. Dantley was traded away and Griffith suffered from injuries. (\"Dr. Dunkenstein was paying his toll\", he once said in an interview.) He missed the entire 1985\u201386 season due to a stress fracture in his foot, and would lose his starting position when he returned. Griffith would need an operation on his left knee in March 1988, causing him to miss the remainder of that season. He managed to reclaim his starting spot for most of the 1988\u201389 season, but lost it permanently the following year. His playing time gradually decreased until his retirement in 1991. He scored 12,391 total points over the course of his 10-year professional career \u2013 all with the Jazz. The franchise recognized his contributions by retiring his jersey number 35 on December 4, 1993.Griffith is now a special assistant to the President of the University of Louisville.

She first distinguished herself in tennis as a middle-school student, reaching the semifinals of the All Japan Middle School Tennis Championships in both 2004 and 2006 and joining the ITF Junior Circuit in 2006. In 2007, while enrolled as a freshman in Sundai K\u014dei High School, Doi earned second place in the Japan Open Junior Championships in Nagoya. A highlight of Doi's junior career was her successful doubles partnership with age-mate Kurumi Nara. They placed second in girls' doubles at the 2007 Wimbledon Championships, becoming only the second Japanese pair to reach the finals of a Grand Slam juniors event since Yuka Yoshida and Hiroko Mochizuki at the 1993 US Open. Doi and Nara continued their run by advancing to the girls' doubles semifinals at a number of high-profile tournaments, such as the 2007 US Open and Wimbledon 2008. Doi also teamed with Romanian Elena Bogdan to place second in girls' doubles at the 2008 Australian Open. This flurry of successes catapulted Doi to No. 3 in Japan's under-18 tennis rankings for 2007; she had been recognized early on as one of Japan's rising stars in junior tennis. 2008 marked Doi's first participation in ITF Women's Circuit events. She partnered with Kurumi Nara again for the 2008 ITF event in Miyazaki, where they upset top-seeded sisters Erika and Yurika Sema, 3\u20136, 6\u20133, [10\u20136] in the second round.

In March 2009, she won her first ITF title at the $10k Kofu event. In October, she made her tour debut in the qualifiers of the Japan Women's Open, falling to American Abigail Spears in the second qualifying round. Doi was seeded sixth in the women's singles draw of the All Japan Tennis Championships. She lost in straight sets to Akiko Morigami in the round of 16. Her performance in 2009's events lifted Doi from a year-opening ranking of No. 613 to a year-end mark of No. 199 and a place among the top 10-players in Japanese tennis. 2010: First Grand Slam qualifying In 2010, Doi began playing professional tournaments outside Japan. She appeared in the women's singles qualifiers for that year's Australian Open. Doi then made appearances at several circuit tournaments, placing second in singles at Irapuato, Mexico in March. In doubles, she recorded three second-place finishes in as many weeks in April tournaments at Incheon, Gimhae, and Changwon, South Korea, with partner Junri Namigata. With new partner Kotomi Takahata, Doi won her first $50k title in doubles at the Fukuoka International in May, defeating Marina Erakovic and Alexandra Panova in straight sets.Her success continued in the qualifying rounds of the French Open, where she defeated Mandy Minella and upset Michelle Larcher de Brito to reach the qualifier finals. With her victory over Vitalia Diatchenko, Doi had earned a spot in her first major tournament main draw, where she lost to Polona Hercog in the first round. She finished the year with a first-place performance in the All Japan Tennis Championships women's singles. 2011: First Grand Slam main-draw win Doi's Grand Slam results improved in 2011, when she qualified for Wimbledon and had her first win in Grand Slam tournament against Bethanie Mattek-Sands. She went on to defeat Zheng Jie before losing in the third round to Sabine Lisicki. 2012: First WTA Tour quarterfinal The Birmingham Classic was Doi's first appearance in the quarterfinals of a singles tour event, which she reached by defeating the top seed Francesca Schiavone in two sets. Although Doi lost in the Wimbledon qualifiers to Kristina Mladenovic, she received a lucky loser berth in the main tournament. She was defeated by her first-round opponent Arantxa Rus. After failing to qualify for the main draws of the US Open and Pan Pacific Open, Doi found success at the Japan Women's Open, where she defeated Chanelle Scheepers in three sets to reach her first tour semifinal. 2013: Main-draw appearance at all major tournaments 2013 marked the first year in which Doi qualified for all four Grand Slam tournaments.

He was promoted to tenth following penalties for Valtteri Bottas and Lando Norris but started ninth after Sergio P\u00e9rez crashed on his reconnaissance lap.

This race would be Latifi's final points finish of the season. At the Dutch Grand Prix, Latifi progressed to Q2 for the second race in a row. However during a flying lap, Latifi lost control of his car and shunted into the wall, qualifying 14th. However, Latifi would be relegated to start from the pit lane due to change car components overnight.

A controversial decision taken during the safety car period by race director Michael Masi allowed Max Verstappen, who was running in second place before the crash, to overtake leader Lewis Hamilton and win both the race and the World Drivers' Championship. Latifi subsequently apologized for the incident, for which he was the target of threats and hate messages from fans on social media. On 21 December, he released a statement on his website addressing the online abuse he received, which he described as \"shocking \u2013 and something I am calling out.\" 2022 season Latifi stayed with Williams for the 2022 season, alongside a new teammate, former Red Bull driver Alex Albon.At the Bahrain Grand Prix, Latifi qualified last, in 20th for the first race in the new era. He lacked pace and finished 16th, only ahead of Nico H\u00fclkenberg. At the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, his weekend was \"disappointing\", as he crashed on his own during both qualifying and the race. At the Australian Grand Prix, Latifi was involved in another crash in qualifying, this time colliding with Lance Stroll. Stroll was given a penalty for the incident. He finished 16th in the race, struggling for pace. At the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, Latifi finished 16th in the race. By this point Latifi had yet to finish higher than 16th place while teammate Albon had scored a point. This saw Williams team boss Jost Capito to \"rebuilt [his] confidence\".At the Miami Grand Prix, Latifi secured his highest finish up till that point, 14th in an incident-packed race. The Spanish Grand Prix saw him finish 16th, the first time he finished ahead of Albon as teammates. Latifi crashed on the formation lap of the Monaco Grand Prix, but managed to start the race, which he finished in 15th. After the race, Carlos Sainz accused Latifi of costing him the victory by holding him up under blue flags. At his first home Canadian Grand Prix, Latifi crossed the line in 16th place. Due to poor performances, Latifi was rumoured to be replaced by 2021 F2 champion Oscar Piastri following the Canadian Grand Prix, but Capito declined that statement. Latifi reached the third qualifying session (Q3) for the first time at the British Grand Prix, qualifying tenth. He improved to eighth at the start, but suffered floor damage later and eventually finished 12th.

At the French Grand Prix, Latifi retired after colliding with Kevin Magnussen on lap 38. At the Hungarian Grand Prix, Latifi topped the final practice session in wet conditions.

Front wing damage compromised the start of his race, and he finished just behind Albon in 18th place.At the Belgian Grand Prix, Latifi qualified in 17th place but started 11th due to grid penalties. On lap 2 of the race, Latifi spun and tagged Valtteri Bottas which knocked the Alfa Romeo driver out of the race. Latifi pitted for repairs and finished the race a lap down, in 18th place. Soon after that, before the Dutch Grand Prix, he revealed the criteria to secure his seat for the 2023 F1 season, which was to \"deliver [Williams] some consistent performances.\"At the Italian Grand Prix, teammate Albon was forced to withdraw from the weekend following FP2 due to appendicitis. This meant that Latifi's teammate for the qualifying session and Grand Prix was Nyck de Vries, who beat him to the F2 title in 2019. De Vries reached Q2 in the qualifying session, whilst Latifi didn't get out of Q1, missing a chicane on his final run. In the race, De Vries scored points, finishing ninth, whilst Latifi finished 15th. This meant that De Vries went ahead of Latifi in the Drivers' Championship. At the Singapore Grand Prix, Latifi started last and his race ended on lap 7 when he collided with Zhou Guanyu, which caused a puncture for Latifi and ultimately his retirement from the race. Additionally, Latifi was given a five-place grid drop for next race at the Japanese Grand Prix.Having qualified last in Japan, Latifi pitted for intermediate tyres at the end of a safety car restart, and narrowly lost to Sebastian Vettel in the pit stops. It would be the right gamble, exiting in eighth. He held off Lando Norris to claim ninth place, and his first points of the season whilst describing it as a \"nice reward\". His result lifted him from 21st to 20th in the drivers' championship. Latifi finished last at the United States Grand Prix, as an early spin saw him ruin his pit strategy and was also compounded with a five-second penalty for forcing Mick Schumacher off track. At the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Latifi ended his F1 career by being sent rearwards into the barriers by Schumacher. He later suffered a technical issue and retired. Latifi ended the drivers' championship 20th in the championship with two points.Latifi left Williams at the end of the 2022 season after spending three seasons with the team and was replaced by F2 graduate Logan Sargeant.

Early life March was born in Racine, Wisconsin, the son of Cora Brown Marcher (1863\u20131936), a schoolteacher from England, and John F. Bickel (1859\u20131941), a devout Presbyterian Church elder who worked in the wholesale hardware business. March attended the Winslow Elementary School (established in 1855), Racine High School, and the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, where he was a member of Alpha Delta Phi.March served in the United States Army during World War I as an artillery lieutenant. He began a career as a banker, but an emergency appendectomy caused him to re-evaluate his life, and in 1920, he began working as an \"extra\" in movies made in New York City, using a shortened form of his mother's maiden name. He appeared on Broadway in 1926, and by the end of the decade, he signed a film contract with Paramount Pictures. Career Like Laurence Olivier, March had a rare protean quality to his acting that allowed him to assume almost any persona convincingly, from Robert Browning to William Jennings Bryan to Dr Jekyll - or Mr. Hyde. He received an Oscar nomination for the 4th Academy Awards in 1930 for The Royal Family of Broadway, in which he played a role modeled on John Barrymore. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the 5th Academy Awards in 1932 for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (tied with Wallace Beery for The Champ, although March accrued one more vote than Beery). This led to roles in a series of classic films based on stage hits and classic novels like Design for Living (1933) with Gary Cooper and Miriam Hopkins; Death Takes a Holiday (1934); Les Mis\u00e9rables (1935) with Charles Laughton; Anna Karenina (1935) with Greta Garbo; Anthony Adverse (1936) with Olivia de Havilland; and as the original Norman Maine in A Star is Born (1937) with Janet Gaynor, for which he received his third Academy Award nomination. March resisted signing long-term contracts with the studios, enabling him to play roles in films from a variety of studios. He returned to Broadway after a ten-year absence in 1937 with a notable flop, Yr. Obedient Husband, but after the success of Thornton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth, he focused as much on Broadway as on Hollywood. He won two Best Actor Tony Awards: in 1947 for the play Years Ago, written by Ruth Gordon and in 1957 for his performance as James Tyrone in the original Broadway production of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night. He also had major successes in A Bell for Adano in 1944 and Gideon in 1961, and he played in Ibsen's An Enemy of the People on Broadway in 1951. During this period, he also starred in films, including I Married a Witch (1942) and Another Part of the Forest (1948). March won his second Oscar in 1946 for The Best Years of Our Lives. March also branched out into television, winning Emmy nominations for his third attempt at The Royal Family for the series The Best of Broadway as well as for television performances as Samuel Dodsworth and Ebenezer Scrooge. On March 25, 1954, March co-hosted the 26th Annual Academy Awards ceremony from New York City, with co-host Donald O'Connor in Los Angeles. March's neighbor in Connecticut, playwright Arthur Miller, was thought to favor March to inaugurate the part of Willy Loman in the Pulitzer Prize-winning Death of a Salesman (1949). However, March read the play and turned down the role, whereupon director Elia Kazan cast Lee J. Cobb as Willy and Arthur Kennedy as one of Willy's sons, Biff Loman. Cobb and Kennedy were two actors with whom the director had worked in the film Boomerang (1947). March later regretted turning down the role and finally played Willy Loman in Columbia Pictures's 1951 film version of the play, directed by Laslo Benedek. March earned his fifth and final Oscar nomination as well as a Golden Globe Award. He also played one of two leads in The Desperate Hours (1955) with Humphrey Bogart. Bogart and Spencer Tracy had both insisted upon top billing, and Tracy withdrew, leaving the part available for March. In 1957, March was awarded the George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for \"distinguished contribution to the art of film\".On February 12, 1959, March appeared before a joint session of the 86th United States Congress, reading the Gettysburg Address as part of a commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth.March co-starred with Spencer Tracy in the 1960 Stanley Kramer film Inherit the Wind, in which he played a dramatized version of famous orator and political figure William Jennings Bryan. March's Bible-thumping character provided a rival for Tracy's Clarence Darrow-inspired character. In the 1960s, March's film career continued with a performance as President Jordan Lyman in the political thriller Seven Days in May (1964) in which he co-starred with Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, and Edmond O'Brien; the part earned March a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor. March made several spoken word recordings, including a version of Oscar Wilde's The Selfish Giant issued in 1945 in which he narrated and played the title role, and The Sounds of History, a twelve volume LP set accompanying the twelve volume set of books The Life History of the United States, published by Time-Life. The recordings were narrated by Charles Collingwood, with March and his wife Florence Eldridge performing dramatic readings from historical documents and literature. Following surgery for prostate cancer in 1970, it seemed his career was over; yet, he managed to give one last performance in The Iceman Cometh (1973) as the complicated Irish saloon keeper, Harry Hope. Marriage and public activities March was married to actress Florence Eldridge from 1927 until his death in 1975, and they had two adopted children. They appeared in seven films together, the last being Inherit the Wind.March and Eldridge commissioned Wallace Neff to build their house in Ridgeview Drive, Bel Air, in 1934. It has subsequently been owned by the philanthropist Wallis Annenberg and the actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston.Throughout his life, March and Eldridge were supporters of the Democratic Party. In July 1936, March co-founded the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League (HANL), along with the writers Dorothy Parker and Donald Ogden Stewart, the director Fritz Lang, and the composer Oscar Hammerstein. In 1938, March was one of many Hollywood personalities who were investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and the hunt for Communists in the film community. In July 1940, he was among a number of individuals who were questioned by a HUAC subcommittee which was led by Representative Martin Dies Jr.Later, in 1948, he and his wife sued the anti-communist publication Counterattack for defamation, seeking $250,000 in damages. The suit was settled out of court.March died of prostate cancer, at the age of 77, in Los Angeles, and he was buried at his estate in New Milford, Connecticut. Tributes March has a star for motion pictures on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1620 Vine Street.Biographies of March include Fredric March: Craftsman First, Star Second by Deborah C. Peterson (1996), and Fredric March: A Consummate Actor (2013) by Charles Tranberg. Misunderstanding March was briefly a member of an interfraternity society composed of leading students formed at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1919 and 1920 named the Ku Klux Klan which is not believed to have been affiliated with the notorious organization of that name. In actuality, March was an outspoken proponent of the civil rights movement for five decades, and worked closely with the NAACP. When the collegiate organization was named, the (later national) KKK was a small regional organization. As the national KKK became better known, the collegiate organization changed its name in 1922.False rumors based on a misunderstanding of the organization of which March was a member were spread on social media that March was a white supremacist. The 500-seat theater at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Oshkosh was formerly named after March. The University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison had named the 168-seat at the Memorial Union as the Fredric March Play Circle Theater; however, in 2018, his name was removed, after student protests following reports of March's membership in a student fraternal organization calling itself Ku Klux Klan. UW\u2013Oshkosh pulled March's name from what is now the Theatre Arts Center shortly before the 2020\u201321 academic term.

His technique has been compared to percussion. Referring to the number of keys on a standard piano, Val Wilmer used the phrase \"eighty-eight tuned drums\" to describe Taylor's style. He has been referred to as being \"like Art Tatum with contemporary-classical leanings\".  Early life and education Cecil Percival Taylor was born on March 25, 1929, in Long Island City, Queens, and raised in Corona, Queens. As an only child to a middle-class family, Taylor's mother encouraged him to play music at an early age. He began playing piano at age six and went on to study at the New York College of Music and New England Conservatory in Boston. At the New England Conservatory, Taylor majored in composition and arranging. During his time there, he also became familiar with contemporary European art music. Bela Bart\u00f3k and Karlheinz Stockhausen notably influenced his music.In 1955, Taylor moved back to New York City from Boston. He formed a quartet with soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy, bassist Buell Neidlinger, and drummer Dennis Charles. Taylor's first recording, Jazz Advance, featured Lacy and was released in 1956. The recording is described by Richard Cook and Brian Morton in the Penguin Guide to Jazz: \"While there are still many nods to conventional post-bop form in this set, it already points to the freedoms in which the pianist would later immerse himself.\" Taylor's quartet featuring Lacy also appeared at the 1957 Newport Jazz Festival, which was made into the album At Newport. Taylor collaborated with saxophonist John Coltrane in 1958 on Stereo Drive, now available as Coltrane Time. 1950s and early 1960s Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Taylor's music grew more complex and moved away from existing jazz styles. Gigs were often hard to come by, and club owners found that Taylor's approach of playing long pieces tended to impede business. His 1959 LP record Looking Ahead! showcased his innovation as a creator as compared to the jazz mainstream. Unlike others at the time, Taylor utilized virtuosic techniques and made swift stylistic shifts from phrase to phrase. These qualities, among others, still remained notable distinctions of his music for the rest of his life.Landmark recordings, such as Unit Structures (1966), also appeared. Within the Cecil Taylor Unit (a distinction that was often used at performances and recordings between 1962 and 2006 for a shifting group of sidemen), musicians were able to develop new forms of conversational interplay. In the early 1960s, an uncredited Albert Ayler worked with Taylor, jamming and appearing on at least one recording, Four, which was unreleased until appearing on the 2004 Ayler box set Holy Ghost: Rare & Unissued Recordings (1962\u201370).By 1961, Taylor was working regularly with alto saxophonist Jimmy Lyons, who would become one of his most important and consistent collaborators. Taylor, Lyons, and drummer Sunny Murray (and later Andrew Cyrille) formed the core personnel of the Cecil Taylor Unit, Taylor's primary ensemble until Lyons' death in 1986. Lyons' playing, strongly influenced by jazz icon Charlie Parker, retained a strong blues sensibility and helped keep Taylor's increasingly avant garde music tethered to the jazz tradition. Late 1960s and 1970s Taylor began to perform solo concerts in the latter half of the 1960s. The first known recorded solo performance was \"Carmen With Rings\" (59 minutes) in De Doelen concert hall in Rotterdam on July 1, 1967. Two days earlier, Taylor had played the same composition in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. Many of his later concerts were released on album and include Indent (1973), side one of Spring of Two Blue-J's (1973), Silent Tongues (1974), Garden (1982), For Olim (1987), Erzulie Maketh Scent (1989), and The Tree of Life (1998). He began to garner critical and popular acclaim, playing for Jimmy Carter on the White House Lawn, lecturing as an artist-in-residence at universities, and eventually being awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1973 and a MacArthur Fellowship in 1991.In 1976, Taylor directed a production of Adrienne Kennedy's A Rat's Mass at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village of Manhattan. His production combined the original script with a chorus of orchestrated voices used as instruments. Jimmy Lyons, Rashid Bakr, Andy Bey, Karen Borca, David S. Ware, and Raphe Malik performed in the production as the Cecil Taylor Unit, among other musicians and actors. 1980s, 1990s, and the Feel Trio Following Lyons' death in 1986, Taylor formed the Feel Trio in the late 1980s with William Parker on bass and Tony Oxley on drums. The group can be heard on Celebrated Blazons, Looking (Berlin Version) The Feel Trio and the 10-disc set 2 Ts for a Lovely T. Compared to his prior groups with Lyons, the Feel Trio had a more abstract approach, tethered less to jazz tradition and more aligned with the ethos of European free improvisation. He also performed with larger ensembles and big band projects. Taylor's extended residence in Berlin in 1988 was documented by the German label FMP, resulting in a box set of performances in duet and trio with a large number of European free improvisors, including Oxley, Derek Bailey, Evan Parker, Han Bennink, Tristan Honsinger, Louis Moholo, and Paul Lovens. Most of his later recordings have been released on European labels, with the exception of Momentum Space (a meeting with Dewey Redman and Elvin Jones) on Verve\/Gitanes. The classical label Bridge released his 1998 Library of Congress performance Algonquin, a duet with violinist Mat Maneri.Taylor continued to perform for capacity audiences around the world with live concerts, usually playing his favored instrument, a B\u00f6sendorfer piano featuring nine extra lower-register keys. In 1987, he toured England with Australian pianist Roger Woodward, presenting recitals on which Woodward played solo works by Xenakis, Takemitsu, and Feldman, followed by Taylor, also playing solo. A documentary on Taylor, entitled All the Notes, was released on DVD in 2006 by director Chris Felver. Taylor was also featured in a 1981 documentary film entitled Imagine the Sound, in which he discusses and performs his music, poetry, and dance. 2000s Taylor recorded sparingly in the 2000s, but continued to perform with his own ensembles (the Cecil Taylor Ensemble and the Cecil Taylor Big Band) and with other musicians such as Joe Locke, Max Roach, and Amiri Baraka. In 2004, the Cecil Taylor Big Band at the Iridium Jazz Club was nominated a best performance of 2004 by All About Jazz. The Cecil Taylor Trio was nominated for the same at the Highline Ballroom in 2009. The trio consisted of Taylor, Albey Balgochian, and Jackson Krall. In 2010, Triple Point Records released a deluxe limited-edition double LP titled Ailanthus\/Altissima: Bilateral Dimensions of 2 Root Songs, a set of duos with Taylor's longtime collaborator Tony Oxley that was recorded live at the Village Vanguard.In 2013, he was awarded the Kyoto Prize for Music. He was described as \"An Innovative Jazz Musician Who Has Fully Explored the Possibilities of Piano Improvisation\". In 2014, his career and 85th birthday were honored at the Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia with the tribute concert event \"Celebrating Cecil\". In 2016, Taylor received a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art entitled \"Open Plan: Cecil Taylor\".In 2008, Taylor performed with Pauline Oliveros at the Curtis R Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The concert was recorded and is available on a DVD which also features a 75-minute video of a Taylor poetry recital entitled Floating Gardens: The Poetry Of Cecil Taylor. Taylor, along with dancer Min Tanaka, was the subject of Amiel Courtin-Wilson's 2016 documentary film The Silent Eye. Ballet and dance In addition to piano, Taylor was always interested in ballet and dance. His mother, who died while he was young, was a dancer and played the piano and violin. Taylor once said: \"I try to imitate on the piano the leaps in space a dancer makes.\" He collaborated with dancer Dianne McIntyre in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1979, he composed and played the music for a 12-minute ballet, \"Tetra Stomp: Eatin' Rain in Space\", featuring Mikhail Baryshnikov and Heather Watts. Poetry Taylor was a poet, and cited Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, and Amiri Baraka as major influences. He often integrated his poems into his musical performances, and they frequently appear in the liner notes of his albums. The album Chinampas, released by Leo Records in 1987, is a recording of Taylor reciting several of his poems while accompanying himself on percussion. Musical style and legacy According to Steven Block, free jazz originated with Taylor's performances at the Five Spot Cafe in 1957 and with Ornette Coleman in 1959. In 1964, Taylor co-founded the Jazz Composers Guild to enhance opportunities for avant-garde jazz musicians.Taylor's style and methods have been described as \"constructivist\". Despite Scott Yanow's warning regarding Taylor's \"forbidding music\" (\"Suffice it to say that Cecil Taylor's music is not for everyone\"), he praises Taylor's \"remarkable technique and endurance\", and his \"advanced\", \"radical\", \"original\", and uncompromising \"musical vision\".This musical vision is a large part of Taylor's legacy: Playing with Taylor I began to be liberated from thinking about chords. I'd been imitating John Coltrane unsuccessfully and because of that I was really chord conscious. Personal life and death In 1982, jazz critic Stanley Crouch wrote that Taylor was gay, prompting an angry response. In 1991, Taylor told a New York Times reporter \"[s]omeone once asked me if I was gay. I said, 'Do you think a three-letter word defines the complexity of my humanity?' I avoid the trap of easy definition.\"Taylor moved to Fort Greene, Brooklyn, in 1983. He died at his Brooklyn residence on April 5, 2018, at the age of 89. At the time of his death, Taylor was working on an autobiography and future concerts, among other projects.

He founded The Spycollective in 2006, a now defunct music, theater and dance group, and is a founding director of Artek Foundation. Vega has been composing and performing internationally since 2001 and is also a founding member of The Electronic Hammer trio with Diego Espinosa and Juan Parra Cancino. He is married to Polish composer Kasia Glowicka.  Education Vega studied composition at Florida International University between 1993 and 1999 with the composer Orlando Jacinto Garcia and later between 1999 and 2004 he completed a Masters in Music at the University of North Texas studying under electroacoustic musician Jon Nelson. He moved to Europe in 2001, where he studied at the Institute of Sonology at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague and received a Master of Music in Sonology. Between 2004 and 2008, he then completed a PhD from Queen's University Belfast at the Sonic Arts Research Centre (SARC). Style One of Vega's influences came from working with American composer Earle Brown, who was a modern proponent of the Open Form style of composition and a father of aleatoric music. This inspired Vega to compose pieces with the idea of \"blocks of music,\" where performers had the freedom of interpretation (not improvisation) to play a block repeatedly until cue'd to another block. Vega said, \"\"This makes an impression of synchronisity between the performers, even though while they are in the block, they are completely unsynchronised.\"In writing about performances during Gaudeamus Week in Amsterdam, Peter Grahame and Alexa Woolf praised Vega as a composer, \"who is dedicated to the creation and promotion of electro-acoustic music; the three female singers (in Idoru in Metals) creating 'an idolized computer-programmed singer, whose imaginary capabilities are infinite'... Great sounds, and splendid dissemination of them in Amvest Zaal (Room in Beurs van Berlage).In a 2012 interview, Vega noted several influences on his composition Wormsongs, including the futurist writings of philosopher Max More and a text from the artist Georg Hobmeier. He also noted the musical inspiration coming from composers such as Kenneth Gaburo, Philip Glass, and Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti. The use of text and the musical style combine to inspire Vega in the potential of technology as a force in musical performance and composition. He said, \"One of the themes that More talks about is overcoming the fear of technology, learning to coexist with it and internalize it.\"Another work Vega composed from philosophical influence was Fogpatch, in collaboration with German media artist and architect, Daniel Fetzner and performance artist Georg Hobmeier (The SpyCollective). Vega's electronic compositions accompanied a theatrical performance based on an experience of German philosopher Max Bense. The project explored the fundamental conflicts between art and technology by reconstructing a traumatic body experience Bense had in San Francisco. Residency at STEIM During his Artistic Residency at the Studio for Electro Instrumental Music (STEIM) in Amsterdam, Vega developed, composed, rehearsed and collaborated on projects such as the electronic-music theatre piece Iminami, his work Wormsongs and also the piece \"Slow slower.\" Awards April, 2005 - Confluencias 3rd Intl.

Early life and Holocaust experiences On April 26, 1944, the collection of Jews in Nagykanizsa began, and they were herded into the Nagykanizsa Ghetto. Around 1800 people were gathered there, including Jaranyi. The ghettoization was handled by Hungarian security forces rather than German soldiers. On April 28, 1944, all Jewish men were deported from the ghetto by train for Auschwitz. On May 18, 1944, all remaining people were taken from the ghetto and sent to the same destination. The train ride took six days, which Jaranyi describes in her memoir in detail.When Jaranyi arrived at Auschwitz, she was sorted into Birkenau, one camp of many inside of Auschwitz. The Flowers From My Mother's Garden recounts her time in Auschwitz and subsequent transfer to Neustadt-Glewe, a satellite work camp of the women-only Ravensbr\u00fcck Concentration Camp.

He coached Canada at the 1968 Winter Olympics, winning one bronze medal.  He would also play professionally in the National Hockey League  with the New York Rangers.  He was inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame in 1999.  Biography McLean was born in New York City. His father, John Sr., played guitar in Tiny Bradshaw's orchestra. After his father's death in 1939, Jackie's musical education was continued by his godfather, his record-store-owning stepfather, and several noted teachers. He also received informal tutoring from neighbors Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, and Charlie Parker. During high school McLean played in a band with Kenny Drew, Sonny Rollins, and Andy Kirk, Jr. (the saxophonist son of Andy Kirk). Along with Rollins, McLean played on Miles Davis' Dig album, when he was 20 years old. As a young man he also recorded with Gene Ammons, Charles Mingus (for Pithecanthropus Erectus), George Wallington, and as a member of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers. McLean joined Blakey after reportedly being punched by Mingus. Fearing for his life, McLean pulled out a knife and contemplated using it against Mingus in self-defense, but later stated that he was grateful that he had not stabbed the bassist.McLean's early recordings as leader were in the hard bop school. He later became an exponent of modal jazz without abandoning his foundation in hard bop. Throughout his career he was known for a distinctive tone, akin to the tenor saxophone and often described with such adjectives as \"bitter-sweet\", \"piercing\", or \"searing\", a slightly sharp pitch, and a strong foundation in the blues. McLean was a heroin addict throughout his early career, and the resulting loss of his New York City cabaret card forced him to undertake a large number of recording dates to earn income in the absence of nightclub performance opportunities. Consequently, he produced an extensive body of recorded work in the 1950s and 1960s. He was under contract with Blue Note Records from 1959 to 1967, having previously recorded for Prestige. Blue Note offered better pay and more artistic control than other labels, and his work for this organization is highly regarded and includes leadership and sideman dates with a wide range of musicians, including Donald Byrd, Sonny Clark, Lee Morgan, Ornette Coleman, Dexter Gordon, Freddie Redd, Billy Higgins, Freddie Hubbard, Grachan Moncur III, Bobby Hutcherson, Mal Waldron, Tina Brooks and many others. In 1962, he recorded Let Freedom Ring for Blue Note. This album was the culmination of attempts he had made over the years to deal with harmonic problems in jazz, incorporating ideas from the free jazz developments of Ornette Coleman and the \"new breed\" which inspired his blending of hard bop with the \"new thing\": \"the search is on, Let Freedom Ring\". Let Freedom Ring began a period in which he performed with avant-garde jazz musicians rather than the veteran hard bop performers he had been playing with previously. His adaptation of modal jazz and free jazz innovations to his vision of hard bop made his recordings from 1962 on distinctive. McLean recorded with dozens of musicians and had a gift for spotting talent. Saxophonist Tina Brooks, trumpeter Charles Tolliver, pianist Larry Willis, trumpeter Bill Hardman, and tubist Ray Draper were among those who benefited from McLean's support in the 1950s and 1960s. Drummers such as Tony Williams, Jack DeJohnette, Lenny White, Michael Carvin, and Carl Allen gained important early experience with McLean. In 1967, his recording contract, like those of many other progressive musicians, was terminated by Blue Note's new management. His opportunities to record promised so little pay that he abandoned recording as a way to earn a living, concentrating instead on touring. In 1968, he began teaching at The Hartt School of the University of Hartford. He later set up the university's African American Music Department (now the Jackie McLean Institute of Jazz) and its Bachelor of Music degree in Jazz Studies program. His Steeplechase recording New York Calling, made with his son Ren\u00e9 McLean, showed that by 1980 the assimilation of all influences was complete. In 1970, he and his wife, Dollie McLean, along with jazz bassist Paul (PB) Brown, founded the Artists Collective, Inc. of Hartford, an organization dedicated to preserving the art and culture of the African Diaspora. It provides educational programs and instruction in dance, theatre, music and visual arts. The membership of McLean's later bands were drawn from his students in Hartford, including Steve Davis and his son Ren\u00e9, who is a jazz saxophonist and flautist as well as a jazz educator. Also in McLean's Hartford group was Mark Berman, the jazz pianist and broadway conductor of Smokey Joe's Cafe and Rent. In 1979 he reached No. 53 in the UK Singles Chart with \"Doctor Jackyll and Mister Funk\". This track, released on RCA as a 12\" single, was an unusual sidestep for McLean to contribute towards the funk\/disco revolution of the late 1970s. Many people, at the time, in the clubs where it was played confused the female singers on the track with his name thinking he was actually female. He received an American Jazz Masters fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 2001 and numerous other national and international awards. McLean was the only American jazz musician to found a department of studies at a university and a community-based organization almost simultaneously. Each has existed for over three decades. McLean died on March 31, 2006, in Hartford, Connecticut after a long illness. In 2006, Jackie McLean was elected to the DownBeat Hall of Fame via the International Critics Poll. He is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery, The Bronx, New York City. A. B.
